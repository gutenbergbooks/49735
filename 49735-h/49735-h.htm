<h2>TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE</h2>


<p>No detailed account of the voyage of the Russian
fleet to the Far East has to my knowledge been
published. The newspapers occasionally mentioned
it as being here or there, and of course its doings
in the North Sea are a matter of history; but from
the time it left Tangier until it met its doom at
Tsushima it was practically in oblivion. By chance
this book came into my hands, and I thought it
would interest British readers.</p>

<p>Much has been said in derision of Admiral Rojdestvensky's
fleet, but every one must agree that it was
no mean undertaking to have brought this large
fleet out to the Far East from Russia and laid it
alongside the enemy. This was done, in spite of the
difficulties of coaling without bases and of having
to repair damages in the open sea. The fleet had
to pass countries that were bound by the laws of
neutrality, and some that were actually hostile to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
it. It was driven out of many ports by the ships
of its allies. In spite of all these drawbacks, it
accomplished a tremendous voyage with all "its
units" intact.</p>

<p>That it failed to win the battle is in no way
surprising. A great number of the ships were useless
and obsolete. The crews were disheartened by the
failures of their comrades at Port Arthur. The
beginning of the movements which resulted in the
open mutiny in the Black Sea and in the recent
mutiny at Cronstadt were developing.</p>

<p>Finally, the spirit of the officers was not of the
Nelsonian standard. We find the captain of the
cruiser <i>Ural</i> flaunting his desire to surrender without
striking a blow for his country.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the dates are those
of the Old Style, thirteen days behind those of the
New Style, which has not been adopted by Russia.</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Eugène Sigismondovitch Politovsky, engineer-constructor
of the second deep sea fleet flagship,
was born at Tashkend on November 12th, 1874. He
received his education at the Emperor Nicholas I.
Naval Engineering School, and left it in 1897.
Up to the departure of the fleet for the East he
served at the Admiralty at St. Petersburg. He
went down in his ship, the battleship <i>Kniaz</i> (Prince)
<i>Suvaroff</i>, in the fight of May 14th, 1905. This diary
consists of extracts from his letters to his wife,
which it must be understood were not intended for
publication.</p>

<p>The diary is written entirely from the personal
point of view of the author. He shares with
the human being dearest to him everything that
occupies or interests him. He writes in fragments,
with detached sentences, sometimes snatching a few
spare minutes from his duties for his letters. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
diary is a full one. Scarce a day is omitted from
the departure from Libau up to May 11th.</p>

<p>Involuntarily, one is impressed by the sincerity
and justice of the author's tone. As he thought, so
he wrote.</p>

<p>His style is very simple and graphic, despite its
fragmentary nature.</p>

<p>The author was a constructor, not a sailor. This
was his first cruise. His views of all that he saw
are those of an independent person, bound by no
traditions or clannishness. They appear to be
absolutely impartial. In addition, through his
position on the staff he knew much that remained
unknown to others.</p>

<p>From the very beginning he did not believe in
success for the Russian navy. The further the fleet
went the more apparent did it become to him that
it was going on a desperate and hopeless mission.
"If you could but imagine what is going on," he
writes&mdash;"if it were possible for me to tell you exactly
all about it&mdash;you would be amazed. Should I live,
I will tell you afterwards. No! there is no use our
fighting. Things have come to such a pass that I
can only wring my hands and feel assured that no
one can escape his fate, for this is the only possible
assurance."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p>He took his duty very seriously and responsibly.
Damages to the ships, and especially to the torpedo-boats,
were constantly occurring, and it was
necessary to repair them with self-improvised means
under the most trying circumstances. For instance,
can you not imagine the following scene? A torpedo-boat
in the open sea with a damaged rudder.
Divers must be sent to repair it. The swell is
tremendous, the boat is rolling fearfully, and around
it are sharks. They lower the diver; he is knocked
about by the sea all the time&mdash;take care that he is
not permanently disabled. They watch the sharks
and drive them away with shots from a rifle. In
spite of all these difficulties the repairs are completed.</p>

<p>Not one ship did the fleet leave behind, and
this was in a great measure due to Politovsky.
Whatever the weather, he tirelessly went from one
ship to another, thinking out means of repair and
accommodating himself to the most improbable
and difficult circumstances, and always emerging
from them with honour. Every one remembers
his great work in getting the battleship <i>Apraxin</i>
off the rocks at Gothland, where she had struck,
icebound, in the winter of 1899.</p>

<p>With ships of the <i>Suvaroff</i> class he was well acquainted.
From 1899 he was assistant-constructor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
of the <i>Borodino</i>, and this was probably the reason
of his appointment to the fleet, an appointment
destined to be fatal to him. How passionately he
dreamed of the arrival at Vladivostok and of the
possibility of returning to Russia! Alas! fate
decided otherwise. He perished in his prime,
being but thirty years old. Through his death
our engineer-constructors have suffered a severe
loss.</p>

<p>He was talented, clever, and energetic, with a
vast experience gained from his cruise. What a
valuable man he would have been in the construction
of the new Russian fleet!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

BEGINNING THE VOYAGE</h2>


<p><i>August 28th.</i>&mdash;Events follow each other so fast
that they get confused in the memory.</p>

<p>The return from the club in the morning, a
frightened wife with a telegram, the rush from
Petersburg to Cronstadt, hurried calls, appointment
to the <i>Suvaroff</i>, good-byes, send-offs, a new service,
etc., etc.</p>

<p>I am not yet accustomed to my new surroundings.</p>

<p>To-day I bade good-bye to the captain and officers
of the <i>Borodino</i>, and to the foremen and workmen.
They wished me good luck, drank my health, cheered,
and the band played. They evidently had a very
friendly disposition towards me.</p>

<p>The parting with the foremen and workmen was
cordial. It was very sad to see their doleful faces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
They all cried before the end of their farewell
speeches. I kissed all and thanked them. They
blessed me with the ikon of St. Nicholas. I
promised to give them my photograph as a memento.
I had nothing else to repay them with.
I could think of nothing better.</p>

<p><i>August 30th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday we left Cronstadt. The
Emperor overtook the fleet in the <i>Alexandria</i>, and
steamed round it. All the time bands were playing,
the men cheered, the fleet saluted. It was a superb
sight. At times the smoke from the guns was so
thick that the nearest ships were not visible. To-day
we arrived at Revel at 7 a.m. It is said we are
to remain here for nearly a month.</p>

<p>To-day is the <i>Suvaroff's</i> name-day. There was
mass. No festivities.</p>

<p>8 p.m.&mdash;Such a worry. Nowhere can I find
room for myself. When I was working on board
the <i>Borodino</i>, as you may imagine, I constantly
consoled myself with the thought of rest and of
leave. The <i>Borodino</i> is completed. I might now
have been free, might now have been living at
home with my wife. But ah! fate! It seems
to me that I shall not return. My predecessor in
this cabin that I occupy went mad and was retired.
This may be superstition, but it is nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
unpleasant. It is said that to-day the captain of
the <i>Asia</i> momentarily lost his head and steered
his ship to ram the <i>Apraxin</i>; the presence of mind
of the officer of the watch saved the <i>Asia</i> and
<i>Apraxin</i> from damage.</p>

<p><i>October 3rd.</i>&mdash;At sea, on the way to the island of
Bornholm. Time flies. Daily there are new impressions,
worries, gossip, and work. On the eve
of our departure from Libau there was prayer, with
genuflexions for "Boyarin Zenovie."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Yesterday we had vespers, and to-day mass.
Everything so triumphant and showy! The weather
was glorious. At lunch the band played. Suddenly
it was reported that the torpedo-boat <i>Buistry</i>
(Rapid) had rammed the <i>Oslyabya</i>&mdash;had knocked
a hole in herself and damaged her torpedo-tubes.
The <i>Buistry</i> approached the <i>Suvaroff</i>. With the
help of a megaphone (<i>i.e.</i> a large speaking-trumpet)
the admiral conversed with her. They managed
to plug the holes. It will be my work to mend
them. We shall anchor off Bornholm, where I
hope to repair the torpedo-boat. To-night there
will be danger. We shall all sleep in our clothes
and all guns will be loaded. We shall pass through
a narrow strait. We are afraid of striking on
Japanese mines in these waters. Perhaps there
will be no mines; but considering that long ago
Japanese officers went to Sweden and, it is said,
swore to destroy our fleet, we must be on our guard.
This strait is eminently suitable for torpedo-boat
attacks or for laying down mines. When you get
this letter we shall have passed the dangerous
place, and it is no use your worrying yourself
about it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p>Have things gone badly with Kuropatkin again?
How serious it is! Will there ever be an end to
our reverses?</p>

<p>4 p.m.&mdash;We have passed the island of Bornholm
without stopping. The southern shores of Sweden
were visible. On the way we met a good many
steamers. We are steaming with the greatest
precaution. The fleet is split into several divisions,
steaming at a certain distance from one another.
Each division is surrounded by torpedo-boats.
Whenever a steamer or sailing-ship is observed on
our course or coming toward us, a torpedo-boat
goes ahead and clears the way&mdash;that is, drives them
aside.</p>

<p>It is a pretty sight&mdash;a torpedo-boat going full
speed gliding swiftly over the sea like a snake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Being low in the water, it can scarcely be seen from
afar.</p>

<p><i>October 4th.</i>&mdash;At anchor off the coast of Denmark,
opposite the island of Langeland (Longland). On
board the transport <i>Kamchatka</i>.</p>

<p>Ah me, what a day it has been! We had scarcely
arrived at Langeland when I went on board the
torpedo-boat <i>Buistry</i>, not having even drunk my
coffee. I put on high boots and took my mackintosh.
The <i>Buistry</i> approached the <i>Kamchatka</i>
and the work began. I got as black as the devil
in the bunker. I must have new overalls. I shall
buy some cloth somewhere and give it to a sailor
to make.</p>

<p>High boots are invaluable, but it is a pity they
do not come above the knee, as I sometimes have
to crawl and spoil my trousers, just as I did to-day.
The work in the <i>Buistry</i> is tremendous. The wind
freshened. The torpedo-boat rolled. We should
have worked outboard, but there was too much sea
on; she rolled her deck under. The artificers will
work all night at the inside, and perhaps to-morrow
they may be able to do outside repairs. Towards
the evening it blew so hard that it was useless
thinking of getting on board the <i>Suvaroff</i>. It is very
cramped in the torpedo-boat, and she is still rolling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
very heavily. I went over to the <i>Kamchatka</i>. I do
not yet know if I shall get a cabin to sleep in. I
brought very few cigarettes with me. Here, off
Langeland, are a Danish cruiser and a torpedo-boat
guarding our anchorage from the Japanese, who might
fire a torpedo at us. There are Danish pilots in each
ship, as well as in the torpedo-boats. Once we are
out of the Baltic, the danger from mines will be
passed.</p>

<p>I am sitting in the wardroom of the <i>Kamchatka</i>,
where I have found some paper on which I am
scribbling. If the weather does not abate I shall
have to stay in the <i>Kamchatka</i> until we reach the
next anchorage. They have just come to report
that there are no spare hammocks. I shall have
to spend the night on a sofa in the wardroom, without
undressing. Well, that is no hardship!</p>

<p>I shall sleep somehow, as I am very tired.</p>

<p><i>October 15th</i>, 12 noon.&mdash;At 9 a.m. I went from
the <i>Buistry</i> to the <i>Suvaroff</i>. Find the consul is just
leaving. I fastened my letter No. 3 somehow,
unsigned, and gave it to the consul without a stamp.
I think it will reach you.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock I went to lunch with the admiral,
who conferred on me the Order of St. Anne. This
came as a surprise to me. The order with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
ribbon was sent to me. The admiral is promoted
to vice-admiral and aide-de-camp to the Czar.</p>

<p>3 p.m.&mdash;I lay down hoping to rest, but it was not
to be; I had to go to the <i>Sissoi</i>&mdash;her davits had
broken. They could not lower a single cutter. Off
I went. Here we are at our first anchorage, and
already there are a heap of damages. The <i>Buistry</i>
is damaged; there are breakages in the <i>Sissoi</i>:
in the <i>Jemchug</i> the davits broke and a cutter sank.</p>

<p>Three Danish steamers which coaled us are
damaged. The owners assess the damages at 6,000
roubles (£600). I shall have to go and look at
them.</p>

<p>I do not take into account minor mishaps, such
as the torpedo-boat <i>Prozorlivy</i> (Clearsighted), which
struck her bows somewhere, and of course bent
them. She was, however, able to cope with the
leak herself.</p>

<p><i>October 6th.</i>&mdash;On the way to Cape Skaw.</p>

<p>Another mishap to the <i>Orel</i> (Eagle).<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> At a most
critical moment, when we were going through a
narrow strait, her rudder was injured. She
anchored. The damage is not yet ascertained.
There is probably some scoundrel on board who has
been trying all along to injure the ship. It is supposed
to be one of the crew. We got up anchor at
7 a.m. The weather is fair, but it appears to be
freshening. The wind is beginning to get much
stronger, although the sun is still shining, and there
is not much sea.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p>It is warm here, 12° to 13° R.</p>

<p>The <i>Orel</i> weighed anchor and followed the fleet.</p>

<p><i>October 7th.</i>&mdash;We are not yet up to the Skaw.
Shall be there soon. The weather is very fine again.
I wonder what it will be like in the German Ocean.
We have to put our watches back now.</p>

<p>It is 8.30 on board at this moment. In Petersburg
it is probably not yet 8 o'clock.</p>

<p>I occasionally look at a book, <i>The English Self-teacher</i>,
but I do not get on with it; sometimes I
am lazy, and sometimes people interrupt me.</p>

<p>At anchor off the Skaw. There is no communication
with the shore except through the pilot.
I gave my letter No. 4 to him to post. Sending
a telegram is out of the question. At present
we have stopped at sea, and are not off a port.
We were anxious about the <i>Orel</i> all night. As
I have already told you, she left the fleet, no longer
answered signals, and found herself in a dangerous
place. Now she is anchored with the other ships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>I write to you so often now, that when it will be
difficult to send letters, and they will take a long
time reaching you, you are bound to be anxious.
In any case, I warn you of this. Of course, I shall
write to you as often as possible. I must finish
this letter. The post goes very soon in the <i>Ermak</i>.</p>

<p>The next trip will be of some days' duration. We
have no news of the war. It is very trying. The
torpedo-boat <i>Prozorlivy</i> has damaged her condenser,
and is being sent to Libau. The <i>Jemchug</i> lost a
cutter and broke the davits. The davits were
taken down to-day and sent to the <i>Kamchatka</i>,
where, in hoisting them on board, they fell into the
water and sank.</p>

<p>How strict discipline is now! A signal was
made to the <i>Ermak</i>. She did not answer, so
they began firing projectiles under her stern.
After such a reminder she quickly responded.</p>

<p>At three o'clock a Swedish steamer approached
the fleet, flying a signal that she had very important
dispatches. Apparently the Russian agent reported
that a very suspicious three-masted sailing ship had
sailed from the fiords. An order has now been
given to train all guns on every passing vessel.
We met ships hitherto, but the torpedo-boats always
drove them out of the way. We have already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
passed the most dangerous spots. Half an hour
ago it was reported to the admiral that either the
<i>Navarin</i> or the <i>Nachimoff</i> (I do not remember
which) had signalled that they had seen two
balloons. What can this be? Can it be the
Japanese?</p>

<p>8 p.m.&mdash;Panic prevails on board. Every one examines
the sea intently. The weather is glorious.
It is warm. There is moonlight. The slightest
suspicious-looking spot in the water is carefully
watched. The guns are loaded. The crew are
standing about on deck. One half will sleep at
their guns without undressing; the other half and
officers will keep watch to-night. It is curious that
we are so far from the theatre of war and yet so
much alarmed. The crew treat the matter seriously.</p>

<p>By the way, I will tell you the following incident.
A sailor of the Revel half "equipage" asked
to be allowed to go to the war in one of the
ships. His request was refused. He thereupon
climbed into the hold of one of the transports and
remained there until now. Imagine how many
days he passed in the fetid hold of the transport!
Besides that, he would be suspected of being a
deserter&mdash;that is, to have committed a severely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
punishable offence. No doubt they will inform
Revel and keep him in the fleet. A curious incident,
is it not? I wish the whole thing were over.
Every one's nerves are strained just now. There
are some officers in the fleet who have returned from
Port Arthur, and they say that people out there are
not nearly as nervous as they are in Russia.</p>

<p>The following details will show you how accustomed
they have grown to the position. The crews
of the ships at Port Arthur asked leave to go to the
advanced positions, and returned under the influence
of liquor. No one could understand how they
became drunk. In the town liquors were not sold,
and yet men went to the advanced positions and
returned intoxicated. At last it was discovered,
and how do you suppose? It appears that the
sailors went to the front in order to kill one of the
enemy and take away his brandy-flask. Just
imagine such a thing. They risked their lives to
get drunk! They did all this without thinking anything
of it, and contrived to conceal it from the
authorities.</p>

<p><i>October 8th.</i>&mdash;The German Ocean (North Sea).</p>

<p>What a night it has been&mdash;nerve-racking and
restless. Early in the evening all were in a state
of nervous tension and panic. News was received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
at midnight from the foremost ships that they had
observed four suspicious torpedo-boats without
lights. Vigilance was redoubled, but thank God
the night passed happily. At present there is a fog.
Nothing is visible all around. The sirens which you
dislike so much are shrieking. I went to bed,
dressed, last night, and did not cover myself with
the counterpane, but just threw my overalls over
me. In the night I froze, so covered my feet with
a rug. The rug was very useful&mdash;many thanks
to you for it.</p>

<p>We are now in the German Ocean. They say it
will be rough. At present it is calm, but foggy. We
go from the Skaw to Brest, in France. There, there
will be no communication with the shore, it is said.
It will be strange if we arrive in the East without
having once set foot on dry land&mdash;and that seems
likely to happen; circumnavigating the world and
not seeing a single town&mdash;how that would please
you!</p>

<p>9 p.m.&mdash;A signal has just been received (by
wireless telegraphy) that the <i>Kamchatka</i>, which had
dropped far astern, was attacked by torpedo-boats.
Just off to find out details.</p>

<p>10 p.m.&mdash;The <i>Kamchatka</i> reports that she is
attacked on all sides by eight torpedo-boats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p><i>October 9th.</i>&mdash;Night of October 9th.</p>

<p>The <i>Kamchatka</i> is asking the position of the fleet.
She says she has altered course and that the torpedo-boats
have gone. On board us they think that the
Japanese are asking the position of the fleet. The
wind has freshened. The <i>Suvaroff</i> is rolling. If it
continues to freshen, the torpedo-boats will be
obliged to give up following and make for the
nearest shore.</p>

<p>My God! what will the fleet do then?</p>

<p>About 1 a.m. they sounded off quarters, having
seen ships ahead. They let the ships get nearer,
and then there began....</p>

<p>What it was words fail to describe! All the
ships of our division were ablaze. The noise of the
firing was incessant. The searchlights were turned
on. I was on the after bridge, and was positively
blinded and deafened by the firing. I put my
hands to my ears and bolted below. The rest I
watched from the spar-deck, out of the accommodation-ladder
port.</p>

<p>A small steamer was rolling helplessly on the sea.
One funnel, a bridge, and the red and black paint on
her side were clearly visible. I saw no one on deck&mdash;they
had probably hidden themselves below in
terror. First one, then another projectile from our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
ship struck this unfortunate steamer. I saw there
was an explosion. The order to cease firing was
given, but the other ships continued to fire and no
doubt sank the steamer. A second and third steamer
not having any one on deck rolled helplessly in
the same fashion. The <i>Suvaroff</i> did not fire on
them.</p>

<p>Imagine the feelings of the people in these ships!
They were, no doubt, fishermen. Now there will
be a universal scandal. As a matter of fact they are
to blame themselves. They must have known our
fleet was coming, and they must have known the
Japanese wished to destroy it. They saw the fleet.
Why did they not cut adrift their nets, if they had
them out, and get out of the way? The nets could
be paid for afterwards.</p>

<p>We shall find out at Brest what we have done.
If it was not the <i>Kamchatka</i>, but the Japanese, who
asked the position of the fleet, they will now know
where we are to be found. If that is the case, we
must expect to be attacked to-night. The moon is
shining now, but from 4 to 6 a.m. it will be dark&mdash;the
time most suitable for attack. If only we could
get to the open sea! We shall be perfectly safe
there from these accidents. I do not know whether
to go to bed or not. You know I always like sharing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
even the smallest events with you and telling you of
them. Take care of my letters; they are better than
any diary. Perhaps some day I will read them
myself and refresh my memory about our present
excitements.</p>

<p>2.30 a.m.&mdash;What a misfortune! A signal has
come from the <i>Aurora</i>, "Four underwater shot-holes,
funnels torn, the chaplain severely wounded, and a
captain of a gun slightly."</p>

<p>Our division fired on the <i>Aurora</i>. She and the
<i>Dimitry Donskoi</i> were detached (we are in six divisions).
At the time of the firing on the steamers
the men lost their heads. Probably some one took
her to be Japanese and fired on her with the six-inch
guns; she was very far off. A very, very sad
occurrence. The only consolation is that our shooting
is so good.</p>

<p>3.30 p.m.&mdash;The second and third steamers about
which I wrote last night suffered a little as well.
The <i>Aurora's</i> chaplain had his hand torn off. They
asked permission to call at the nearest port in order
to send him to hospital. The admiral refused. Six
different projectiles struck the <i>Aurora</i>, whose side
and funnels were pierced. Comparatively few were
injured. The <i>Aurora</i> is to blame for having shown
herself on the horizon, on the side away from us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
She turned her searchlight on us, and by so doing
made us take her to be one of the enemy's ships.</p>

<p>Yesterday, or more correctly this morning, I went
to bed at six o'clock. Again I did not undress. I
slept by snatches, on and off all day. Perhaps there
will be no sleep again to-night.</p>

<p>The barber has just cut my hair. He uses
huge tailor's scissors with cloth-covered handles.
"I did not succeed in buying a proper pair," he
explained, when he saw me looking at his ditty
box.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He cut it very evenly for a self-taught barber.</p>

<p>Whom have we not among the sailors?&mdash;tailors,
bootmakers, locksmiths, cooks, bakers, barbers,
photographers, confectioners, cigarette makers, etc.
All trades are represented, and there is work for
all of them in a battleship. The captain wanted
to be shaved, so he sent an orderly for a barber.
The man arrived (not the one who cut my hair)
and the shaving began. The barber's hand shook
and the captain's face grew red with blood. He
had nearly taken off half his cheek. A fearful row
ensued. The captain, with soapy cheeks, smacked
the heads of the orderly and barber. The latter
tried to excuse himself by saying that he is still
learning. A pretty picture, is it not? Now the
captain shaves himself, not trusting local talent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>11 p.m.&mdash;An eventful day has gone by! At six
o'clock some fishing-nets fouled the screws, but the
engines are working. The fishermen in these parts
tow very long nets, and you have to pass over
them.</p>

<p>We had vespers to-day. How will this night
pass? The weather remains fine. It is calm.
The moon will shine until four o'clock. Perhaps
another fog will come on like last night. All this
morning the sirens were screeching in the fog. We
shall be at the entrance of the English Channel in
the morning. Again they have not served out
hammocks to the crew. They will sleep at their
guns fully dressed.</p>

<p><i>October 10th</i> (7 p.m.).&mdash;In the English Channel,
between England and France.</p>

<p>I have not written to you the whole day, and it
is getting on my conscience.</p>

<p>We had mass in the morning, and then lunch.
Not having slept all night, I lay down to rest. I
slept until 3.30. I worked and then dined. I am
only just free. The night passed quietly. It is
raining now, and the ship is gently heaving on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
ocean swell. If nothing further occurs, we shall be
at Brest to-morrow. Passing by England this
morning I saw her southern shores, which were
faintly visible in the mist. Yes, there was "Foggy
Albion." Involuntarily I pondered over this clod
of earth&mdash;so powerful, so rich, so proud, and so
ill-disposed towards us. We are only three hours'
journey from London and six by rail from Paris.</p>

<p>Many varieties of birds settle on the ship, tired
and exhausted by their long flight. The crew feed
them and let them go.</p>

<p>I am depressed&mdash;fearfully depressed. Anxiety
presses on my soul! What would I not give to be
with you now! Again I have not slept all night.
How tiring it all is!</p>

<p><i>October 11th.</i>&mdash;They say it is very possible we shall
not call at Brest. Profiting by the fine weather,
we shall steer straight across the Bay of Biscay.
The bay enjoys a bad reputation. It is seldom
crossed in calm weather. It blows there very
heavily. So far we have had a very fair voyage.</p>

<p>The <i>Korea</i>, which apparently called at Cherbourg,
signals that she has heard nothing of the fleet
having fired on steamers. The torpedo-boat <i>Bravy</i>
has broken something.</p>

<p>Bay of Biscay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Fate herself prevented our going to Brest, and
steered us straight across the Bay of Biscay to
Vigo (Spain).</p>

<p>Such a thick fog came up at 1 p.m. that the ship
astern was not visible. We are steaming through
milk! The sirens are shrieking in turn, one ship
after another.</p>

<p>The following ships are in our division: first the
<i>Suvaroff</i>, next the <i>Alexander III.</i>, then the <i>Borodino</i>,
<i>Orel</i>, and the transport <i>Anadir</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is just as well we did not go to Brest.
The entrance to the port is very difficult, dangerous,
and impossible in a fog.</p>

<p>If we do not go to Crete, from Vigo onwards the
way before us is wide&mdash;the whole ocean!</p>

<p>Lying on my bed last night I watched the rats
making themselves at home in my cabin. I used
to sleep with my feet towards the door, but have
now put my pillow there, because of the rats. They
can jump from the writing-table on to the settee,
and could easily have jumped on my head.</p>

<p>Since we left the port of Alexander III. at Libau,
a fortnight ago, no telegrams have been sent, except
those allowed by the admiral. This was done so
that spies should not warn the Japanese, waiting
for us in the Baltic. The Japanese evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
thought (report said there were more than a hundred
of them in the Baltic) that we should wait for
the <i>Oleg</i> at Libau. The admiral, however, did not
wait for the <i>Oleg</i>, and left. Their spies did not
succeed in warning them. Though telegrams were
received at the office, they were not sent on for two
days. Perhaps this accounts for their inactivity.</p>

<p>Evening.&mdash;The fog dispersed and our division
reassembled. The crew will sleep at their guns
without undressing till we reach Vigo.</p>

<p>I sit in my cabin and try to distract my thoughts.
Such gloom overwhelms me that I feel inclined to
hang myself. I go into the wardroom, take a hand
at dominoes, play with the dogs, or idle about, not
knowing what to do with myself.</p>

<p>There are three dogs who are always to be found
in the wardroom of the <i>Suvaroff</i>. One is a dachs
called "Dinky"; the second a fox-terrier puppy,
"Gipsy"; and the third, "Flagmansky," is something
like a dachs, but white-haired and rough.
Flagmansky and Gipsy are very amusing animals.
They are often played with and teased; corks and
papers are tied to them with string, and they jump
and romp about. Now you know all our amusements.
They are not many!</p>

<p>I go on deck and look at this much-vaunted sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Some one has prepared Flagmansky for the
tropics by cutting off all the hair on his body,
leaving his head like a lion's. The chaplain is
accused of doing this, but he denies it.</p>

<p>We shall arrive at Vigo either to-night or to-morrow
morning. It will be interesting to know
if they will allow us to coal from our transport
<i>Anadir</i>. Coal is getting scarce in the battleships.</p>

<p><i>October 12th.</i>&mdash;We are approaching Spain. Lighthouses
are already visible. We shall be at Vigo
in the morning. We shall all be much relieved,
as we have not called at a single port since we left
Libau. We could go on to Tangier without stopping.
The weather has greatly facilitated our passage.</p>

<p>Admiral Folkersham, commanding the 2nd division
of battleships (in it are the <i>Sissoi</i>, <i>Oslyabya</i>,
<i>Navarin</i>, <i>Nachimoff</i>, and another), distinguished
himself when passing through the English Channel.
He approached the English coast and coaled his
ships from the transports. We are all laughing to
think of the horror of our Minister for Foreign
Affairs (by the way, all the ministers were opposed
to the dispatch of the fleet, but the admiral insisted
on it).</p>

<p>The Minister will be informed of the firing on
the steamers.  That will be the first European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
complication. They will then tell him about the
coaling near England&mdash;a second complication.
Finally he will learn that a whole division of our
fleet has called at the neutral port of Vigo.</p>

<p><i>October 13th.</i>&mdash;In Vigo Bay.</p>

<p>No communication with the shore allowed. I
gave my letter No. 6, of thirty-two pages, to be
forwarded by the Consulate. Of course, there were
no stamps. I wonder if you will get it!</p>

<p>We shall not remain here more than twenty-four
hours. The Spanish authorities do not allow a
longer stay. This place is hot and sunny. There
were 20° R. in the shade. The place is pretty.
There are hills all around. The town is evidently
not large.</p>

<p>12 o'clock.&mdash;The authorities do not allow us to
stop for a moment. In order to gain time, the
admiral asked the local captain of the port to
telegraph to Madrid, to ask that we might stay here
five days to make good defects. In spite of the
prohibition we are about to take in coal, without
which our fleet would be checkmated. Sentries
will be posted over the hawsers (ropes which fasten
the ships to the colliers), with orders to allow no
one to cast them off. What will be the end of all
this?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>A collier lies near each battleship, but they are
not allowed to coal. Telegrams are sent everywhere.
They are now waiting for a reply from
Madrid. Will they really not allow us to coal!</p>

<p>The admiral has received a telegram stating that
England is in a ferment&mdash;not at our having fired
on the steamers, but because the torpedo-boat
which was left on the scene of the drama gave no
help to the sufferers. None of our torpedo-boats
were there. They were at Cherbourg. The admiral
replied to this effect to our ambassador in London.</p>

<p>An answer has been received from Madrid. It
announces that the Government requests us to
refrain from coaling, but will inform us to-morrow
how much we may take.</p>

<p>The admiral ordered a signal to be hoisted for the
fleet, to be in readiness to weigh anchor at 7 a.m.</p>

<p>When the admiral went ashore to-day, he was
met in state. The crowd made an ovation, a description
of which was in the local evening papers.</p>

<p><i>October 14th.</i>&mdash;I gave my letter to a soldier or
police "alguazil," as they call them on board. I
gave him money&mdash;one peseta!</p>

<p>Our battleships lie waiting. It is positively
insulting! Coal, bought by Russia, is in steamers
close alongside and is not allowed to be put on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
board. "Who prevents it?" you ask. Miserable,
beggarly, broken Spain. Undoubtedly the hand
of England is visible in this. The Spaniards make
no secret of it.</p>

<p>At 1 p.m. permission came for each ship to take
in 400 tons. Sailors and officers, dirty and black,
hasten to begin coaling. White tunics and cap-covers
are nowhere to be seen. Everything is black
with coal-dust. Faces are black as soot, and only
teeth gleam white.</p>

<p><i>October 18th.</i>&mdash;They say we leave for Tangier
to-morrow morning. I have been busy all day,
and not able to write.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

OFF NORTH-WEST AFRICA</h2>


<p><i>October 19th.</i>&mdash;On the way from Vigo to Tangier.</p>

<p>Permission came last evening for us to proceed.
At 7 a.m. to-day the fleet weighed anchor and left
Vigo Bay.</p>

<p>I did not succeed in getting ashore. Yesterday
an engineer of the <i>Anadir</i> fell from the upper deck
into the hold, but escaped uninjured.</p>

<p>There is a report in the newspapers that, during
the firing on the steamers in the German Ocean,
the chaplain of the <i>Aurora</i> was wounded, and now
they have sent him into hospital at Tangier, where
the remainder of the fleet are lying. There is no
proper harbour at Tangier&mdash;merely the open sea.
It is unlike Vigo. The latter is one of the best
harbours in the world. It is deep and long and
broad. The Spaniards do not know how to profit
by such natural wealth. Vigo might carry on a
universal trade. At present it is a small provincial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
town on the sea. The Spaniards are very poor,
because they are uncommonly lazy. Vigo trades
mostly in sardines. They have a sardine factory.
The sardines are caught in the bay, which is divided
into squares for each party of fishermen. Heaven
help the fishermen who trespass in the square of
the others. There is a fight at once. This occurs
so often, that there are special ships who part the
fighters and tow the guilty fishermen in their boats
to the shore, for punishment.</p>

<p>The weather is fine at present; but what darkness!
Literally nothing can be seen, and there
are no stars. Only lights that are absolutely necessary
are left on deck. It is dark everywhere.
One has to look out and not bump one's head or
fall.</p>

<p>Something has gone wrong again with the <i>Orel's</i>
steering engine. She continues to keep up with
the others.</p>

<p>About 10 p.m. some ships chased us. They are
now around us, and on the same course as ourselves.
There are five or six of them. At one time it was
completely dark, and then the ships behaved very
defiantly&mdash;now extinguishing all their lights, now
passing us, now chasing us, and now coming close
up to us. Our division is steaming surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
by them. They appear to be warships, judging
by their shape, which we saw when one of them
lighted up another with her searchlight. We are
ordered to log all their man&oelig;uvres, lamp signals,
place of meeting with them, etc. Hammocks are
not served out to the crew, and they sleep at the
guns.</p>

<p>The night has just become a little lighter. Stars
have appeared, though sometimes clouded over.
The stars and the Milky Way recall Tashkend to
me. There, there are the same dark nights and
bright stars.</p>

<p>It is supposed that the ships now surrounding
us are English, and that at dawn they will disperse.</p>

<p>Hope we shall soon get to the ocean. There you
can shape a course one hundred miles off, and no
one will find you.</p>

<p><i>October 20th.</i>&mdash;The English ships escorted us all
night. They are now steaming on each side of us.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock the <i>Orel</i> hoisted a signal that her
steering engine was damaged. All the ships
stopped. The <i>Alexander</i> lowered a boat and sent
the flag engineer to her. At nine o'clock our battleships
and the <i>Anadir</i> proceeded to Tangier.</p>

<p>Sometimes the coasts of Portugal are visible.</p>

<p>When our ships stopped the English probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
took it for a hostile demonstration. They quickly
assembled astern of our division and formed in
battle order. Horrid folk! They are Russia's
eternal enemy. They are cunning, powerful at
sea, and insolent everywhere. All nations hate
England, but it suits them to tolerate her. If you
could only hear how furiously Spaniards abuse the
English! They shake their fists and nearly foam
at the mouth. If they only could, they would
gladly play some low trick on them. How many
impediments has this "Ruler of the Seas" put on
our voyage? Every impediment has come from
Britannia.</p>

<p>Do you know, we have passed by the shores of nine
countries&mdash;Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Belgium,
Holland, England, France, Germany, Spain. We
are now passing by the tenth&mdash;Portugal.</p>

<p>Portugal is considered the ally of England, and
upholds her everywhere.</p>

<p>Evening.&mdash;To-day there was a memorial service
for the Emperor Alexander III. The English
cruisers accompanied us all day, and at dusk again
surrounded us in a semicircle. They are, however,
steaming with lights, and are not playing any of the
tricks they played last night.</p>

<p>If nothing happens we shall be at Tangier at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
3 p.m. to-morrow. An hour ago we passed Cape
St. Vincent (Portuguese), off which a great naval
battle once took place.</p>

<p>It is beginning to be hot and stuffy in the cabins,
although it is pouring with rain.</p>

<p>The number of English cruisers accompanying
us has increased to ten. We are steaming completely
surrounded by them. The ships are in this
order:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i045.jpg" width="600" height="202" alt="" />
</div>

<p>All this respectable company are going in the
direction of the arrow. How small our division
appears compared with the English! Will they
escort us for long in this manner? Perhaps to
Gibraltar, or perhaps even further! The crews
again do not undress, and sleep at the guns. It is
very trying for them.</p>

<p>There has just been a short mass and prayer.
Three engineers, not yet having taken the oath,
were sworn. The officers and men were fallen in
on deck as on Sundays. The admiral made a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
speech on the subject of the ten years' reign of the
Czar, drank a toast, the crew cheered, and the band
played. After that there was a grand lunch in the
wardroom.</p>

<p>Morocco, in Tangier harbour.</p>

<p>The town of Tangier is unlike any we see in
Europe. It is inhabited by Moors and Arabs.
There are Europeans, but they live principally
outside the town, which, with its white houses, is
widely scattered over the hilly coast. From afar
the town is beautiful. No one is allowed on
shore.</p>

<p>You may remember once all the papers wrote
that a Moorish robber had captured an American
and demanded a ransom. This much-respected
person lives twenty-five versts (nearly seventeen
miles) from Tangier, and has built himself a costly
villa with the money. It appears that he still
occupies himself in robbery, and has a tribe of eight
hundred men. No one is allowed to go far from the
town.</p>

<p>We arrived here at three o'clock, and found all
our fleet except the torpedo-boats at anchor. There
are two French ships and an English one lying here
as well.</p>

<p>At five o'clock the hospital-ship <i>Orel</i> arrived. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
is painted white with red crosses on her funnels.
The Red Cross flag is flying at her masthead. The
chaplain of the <i>Aurora</i> who was wounded on the
8th died from blood-poisoning.</p>

<p>There is a report that there are two Japanese
torpedo-boats at Hull, in England. They are probably
some of those who tried to attack our division.</p>

<p>It is rumoured that Russia has bought seven more
cruisers, and that they will join us soon. This would
be excellent. The battleships of our division are
now coaling. There is frightful confusion on board.
The sailors of the ship which coals quickest get a
prize. The crew of the <i>Alexander III.</i> won 1,200
roubles (£120) at the last coaling.</p>

<p>As usual, we have no news about the war! Yesterday
was an anxious day for Port Arthur. The
Japanese wished to hoist their flag there on the
Mikado's birthday.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the <i>Suvaroff</i> anchored, when from
all sides came steam cutters and boats with captains
of ships, paymasters, and other officers. From the
shore came the local authorities, our consul, contractors,
captains of foreign ships&mdash;in a word, every
one is hastening to the <i>Suvaroff</i> like the public to the
play at the theatre! Truly it is like it! From our
ship salutes constantly thunder, various flags are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
hoisted, and the band plays. From the other ships
and from the shore they salute the <i>Suvaroff</i>. The
scene is full of animation.</p>

<p>The native inhabitants dress very picturesquely,
as though they were masquerading. Some are in
jackets with wide breeches and a fez, and others
in turbans and hooded tunics, all of various colours.
The faces of all are very dark. They consider
themselves of importance. It would be interesting
to see them in the town.</p>

<p>Our torpedo-boats have already left for the
Mediterranean. They have done this enormous
journey in nineteen days.</p>

<p>10 p.m.&mdash;In the <i>Gibraltar Chronicle</i> they announce
that Alexieff is leaving, and that Stössel has telegraphed
that Port Arthur will be his grave.</p>

<p><i>October 22nd</i> (night).&mdash;If you could only see what
an inferno this coaling is! The steamers and battleships
are lighted by electricity. The holds below
and the decks are swarming with people. Words of
command are abruptly given, and the band plays
the gayest tunes. The work goes better to music.
Though Morocco is considered under the protection
of France, there is an English post-office, a German
one, and I believe a Spanish one as well.</p>

<p>I have just returned from the steamer <i>Pallas</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
which brought coal for us and damaged her side
while coaling.</p>

<p>A pedlar has just come on board, bringing picture
postcards, mats, nets, white shoes and helmets (you
know the kind the English wear in the tropics). I
have already bought myself a helmet, and the postcards
that are left are not much good, though I
bought six of them and gave one to my servant.
He is delighted. The boots do not fit, and white
boots are an absolute necessity in the tropics.</p>

<p>Our consul's "cavass" has just come on board.
He has a black face; wears a red fez, and a blue
tunic with a hood; has bare legs and yellow heelless
slippers. He is a curious object. He will stay
with us till we leave, and will collect the mails.
We shall have to pay a hundred francs for his
boat. A modest sum!</p>

<p>Am just going on board the <i>Orel</i>. Something is
damaged.... How wet I got! My legs were wet
up to the knees. I went in the cutter to all the
private coal-merchants, looking for the director of
the company, and then on to the <i>Orel</i>. The rain is
falling in bucketfuls, with such heaviness that it
hides the other ships from view like a dense
curtain. It is perfectly beastly. Luckily I have a
mackintosh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>I have a trip to the steamer <i>Esperanza</i> before me.
Hope I shall escape it.</p>

<p>7 p.m.&mdash;Went on board the <i>Esperanza</i>. Wore
high boots, but there was no rain.</p>

<p>The local papers say that another of our ships
has perished off Port Arthur. What is one to
believe? For instance, there is a story in the
papers that our admiral insulted the English admiral
after the latter had tried to prevent our leaving
Vigo. A quarrel ensued, guns were fired, and the
English were beaten by us. They write so many
lies in the local papers.</p>

<p><i>October 25th.</i>&mdash;From Tangier to Dakar.</p>

<p>We left Tangier on the morning of the 23rd, and
are now on our way to Dakar, which lies on the
western shores of Africa, not far from St. Louis
and Cape Verde, and belongs to France.</p>

<p>Have not written to you for a couple of days, for
two reasons. I am very angry and very busy. I
am angry because at Tangier I never received a
wire from you in answer to mine. All day long
yesterday, till the depths of the night, I was busy
with sketches and calculations. I had not a spare
moment.</p>

<p>When weighing anchor at Tangier the <i>Anadir's</i>
anchor caught in the telegraph cable. By order of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the admiral the cable was cut. I suppose there will
again be diplomatic representations over this affair.
No doubt the English will say that it was done
purposely, so that no telegrams should be sent
announcing our departure. It is lucky that the
cable belongs to France. Had it been English the
scandal would have been terrific.</p>

<p>At Tangier I saw a peculiar rainbow. It stretched
from the foot to the summit of a hill.</p>

<p>7 p.m.&mdash;My work is accumulating tremendously.
I began early in the morning, and probably will
be busy again to-night with sketches and calculations.
It will be a long time before you get this
letter. As time goes on, letters will be less frequent.
We have a tremendous journey before us&mdash;seventeen
or eighteen days from port to port&mdash;so do not be
anxious at not receiving news for a very long time.
During our present cruise this is quite a normal
state of affairs.</p>

<p>It is twenty-three days now since I set foot on
shore. The shore is not attractive as a rule. I long
to get quickly to Vladivostok. I am sick to death
of it all. They say the sea is beautiful! I do not
agree with that entirely. It is true the water is
blue, but that is all you can say for it; it is only
blue in calm weather, but in stormy weather it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
appears to me to be a stupid, insane, infuriated
element. Perhaps the sea is beautiful, but only to
those on dry land. I could never be fascinated by
the sea.</p>

<p><i>October 26th.</i>&mdash;The transport <i>Malay</i> broke some
of her machinery at one o'clock last night. The
whole fleet stopped and waited until she had made
the defect good. We remained on the spot till
7 a.m. The <i>Malay</i> repaired engines and the fleet
proceeded. We wasted six hours over it. I count
every hour. The less time we spend in harbour and
the quicker we go, the sooner we shall arrive at
Vladivostok. In a word, Vladivostok is the goal
of our desires.</p>

<p><i>October 27th.</i>&mdash;We passed the Tropic of Cancer
at 4 p.m., and are going towards the Equator. We
are in the tropics, and yet I cannot say that it is
specially hot and airless.</p>

<p>Our squadron going round Africa consists of
the following ships: the battleships <i>Suvaroff</i>,
<i>Alexander</i>, <i>Borodino</i>, <i>Orel</i>, <i>Oslyabya</i>; cruisers,
<i>Dimitry Donskoi</i>, <i>Aurora</i>, <i>Nachimoff</i>; transports,
<i>Kamchatka</i>, <i>Anadir</i>, <i>Meteor</i>, <i>Korea</i>, <i>Malay</i>, and
the hospital-ship <i>Orel</i>. The <i>Meteor</i>, <i>Korea</i>, and
<i>Malay</i> are under the merchant flag; and so is
the <i>Orel</i>, but she is also flying the Red Cross.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>We heard an unpleasant rumour to-day. It is
said the squadron will make a long stay at Madagascar
and carry out various exercises. Can it
be so? This news annoys me. If we are there so
long, when shall we get to Vladivostok? I console
myself with the thought that this is a clever fiction.</p>

<p>The captain laid in a reserve of white soap, which
dissolves in salt water (generally soap does not).
The fresh water is preserved for steaming, so you can
only have a salt-water bath on board. My servant
brought me a piece of this soap yesterday. I do
not know how he obtained it. There is nearly 100
roubles' worth of it on board the <i>Suvaroff</i>.</p>

<p>I have very few cigarettes left&mdash;only six boxes.
It is a good thing you bought me 1,000 at Revel,
and that I bought some at Libau, or I should be
without them.</p>

<p><i>October 28th.</i>&mdash;My servant is evidently attached
to me. He is industrious and inquisitive. Just
after we left Libau he saw a box of pastilles and
said, "Did our barina [lady] really come to Libau,
sir?" He came into my cabin to-day with a
bucket and mop, and said, "Shall I interfere with
your worship if I wash the deck?"</p>

<p>It is very probable that from Dakar we shall go
to Gaboon. We shall call at ports which I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
never heard of before, or if I have it was a very long
time ago&mdash;perhaps at school.</p>

<p>I told the ship's photographer to prepare me a
series of photographs which I will send you. They
are not very characteristic, but better ones are not
to be had.</p>

<p><i>October 29th.</i>&mdash;It is very stuffy to-day. One
perspires a good deal. Last night I slept with only
a sheet over me, and had nothing on but a cross.
Notwithstanding the stuffiness, one is obliged to
sleep with closed ports and deadlights. In time
of war all superfluous lights in a ship are either
extinguished or covered over. If it is so hot here,
it will positively be hell at the Equator. The air
is offensive, being impregnated with steam. It is
damp. The drawers of the tables are beginning
to shut badly. They are sodden. Soon all metallic
objects will begin to rust. I am sitting in my
cabin with my shirt unbuttoned. Experienced
people say that every one will get prickly heat.
This eruption appears in the tropics because the
pores of the skin are constantly irritated. The
heat and stuffiness are unbearable. There is no
wind&mdash;we are in a calm belt. The fans are kept
going incessantly on board. Every one goes about
sunburnt and sleepy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Speed has purposely been lessened in order to
get into Dakar to-morrow morning, and not this
evening.</p>

<p>I think we shall stay in Dakar some days. Heavy
coaling awaits us there&mdash;2,000 tons. All the decks
will be loaded with coal.</p>

<p><i>Dakar, Senegambia.</i></p>

<p><i>October 30th.</i>&mdash;Just arrived at Dakar. The fleet
is anchoring.</p>

<p>The town is situated partly on shore and partly
on a small island.</p>

<p>To-day is the admiral's names-day. They say
there will be an official dinner.</p>

<p>The heat and stuffiness are fearful. Perspiration
pours off one. The air is damp&mdash;towels will not dry.</p>

<p>2 p.m.&mdash;I have been on duty on board the cruiser
<i>Admiral Nachimoff</i>. There I met an engineer whom
I knew at school. I lunched in the <i>Nachimoff</i>, though
there was an official lunch in the <i>Suvaroff</i>. I was not
present. A sister of mercy from the <i>Orel</i> was there.
She is a relation of the admiral's. The admiral
has permitted communication with the shore after
the coal has been taken on board. We remain here
until the evening of November 3rd. All the ships
except ours have begun to coal.</p>

<p>Negroes in small boats are rowing round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
fleet. You throw money into the water for them
and they dive for it. The whole of their costume
consists of a loin-cloth and not a stitch more. They
are repulsive&mdash;black with long, thin legs and arms.
They gave me the impression of being sick, incapable
people.</p>

<p>Apparently, when the <i>Oslyabya</i> was at Tangier,
she asked for a barge and baskets for coaling from
Gibraltar. The English purposely employed all
the barges themselves, and bought up all the baskets.
The <i>Oslyabya</i> received nothing.</p>

<p>5 p.m.&mdash;The French Governor has just arrived
in great state, and explained that he cannot permit
us to coal. The admiral told him that he should,
nevertheless, continue to coal until he had a telegram
from Europe. They have long ago begun
coaling in the other ships, and will soon begin in us.
Perhaps the Governor will announce that we are
not to remain here. That would be a great surprise
to every one. Probably things are going badly
in Manchuria&mdash;the French are evidently also sailing
with the wind. From there (Manchuria) we have
no decisive news.</p>

<p>Evening.&mdash;I hurried off my twenty-second letter
to you as the post was going. It appears that
telegraphing is very expensive from here. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
cable between Dakar and Europe is damaged
somewhere, so telegrams have to be sent round
by America.</p>

<p>There is a report that Stössel is wounded in the
leg. At first the French allowed us to coal, and
then came an order from Paris not allowing us in
harbour. Nevertheless, our fleet remains, and we
are coaling. All the doors and scuttles are tightly
closed to keep out the coal-dust. The stuffiness
is dreadful inside the ship. We are tormented by
thirst. Drinks are hot and unpleasant. All the
same, one drinks incessantly. I alone drank six
bottles of lemonade to-day.</p>

<p>Can you guess what our one topic of conversation
in the fleet is about? Coal! It is our weak
spot. Our comings, our goings, our voyage, and
even our success depend on coal. In order to
stimulate the men, they have established prizes,
which are given to the crew of the ship that coals
quickest.</p>

<p>The everlasting conversation about coaling drives
one frantic, still one talks of it and quarrels about
it.</p>

<p><i>October 31st.</i>&mdash;Since early this morning I have
been round the harbour. Coal-dust has penetrated
everywhere&mdash;into the cabins, the cupboards, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
on to the tables. The decks are clouded with dust.
Every one is so black that you do not recognise
people at once.</p>

<p>There is a report that we shall not call at Gaboon.
Perhaps it is for the best, as we shall proceed sooner;
besides, Gaboon lies almost on the Equator. That
means it would be somewhat warm.</p>

<p>3 p.m.&mdash;They gave us ices for lunch to-day; they
were steaming though cold. The heat is awful.
Precautions are being taken against sunstrokes.
There are some indications that we shall stay here
till Wednesday&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> November 3rd. If we do not
go to Gaboon, but steer for the next port on the
list, we shall have a tremendous trip.</p>

<p>Our admiral called on the local commandant
and invited him to lunch.</p>

<p>Just been urgently summoned on board the
<i>Donskoi</i>.</p>

<p><i>November 1st.</i>&mdash;Just returned from the transport
<i>Malay</i>. She is damaged below the water-line.</p>

<p>Evening.&mdash;At 3 p.m. Lieutenant Nelidoff (son
of our ambassador at Paris) died from sunstroke.
The deceased was a wonderful linguist, knowing
seven or eight languages. He will be buried to-morrow.</p>

<p>Our officers have just returned from the shore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
According to them there is nothing interesting to
be seen. If I can manage it, I shall go ashore to-morrow.
I am too tired to-day.</p>

<p><i>November 2nd</i> (5 p.m.)&mdash;I am sitting in a restaurant,
drinking lemonade. How you would have
laughed just now! I asked the negro waiter for the
menu, and he brought me cards, dice, and a board
covered with cloth. There is nothing to do on shore.
I shall go on board by the first boat. They are
burying Nelidoff. I hear the volleys.</p>

<p>I returned from the shore by the seven o'clock
boat. Our doctor distinguished himself. He tore
some fruit from a tree and ate it. Scarcely had he
returned on board when he was seized with colic
and vomiting.</p>

<p>There are some Japanese here. Our officers saw
two of them. Evidently they are spies.</p>

<p>We leave to-morrow, and I go on board the <i>Donskoi</i>
in the morning. I shall scarcely have time when I
return to add two or three words to this letter before
the post goes. Our trip will be a long one&mdash;about
ten days.</p>

<p>I wandered about Dakar and thought of you all
the time&mdash;with what curiosity you would regard
all these unfamiliar pictures, the niggers, negresses,
children, and lastly even the Europeans! Everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
here is so original. Little children run about
the streets without any signs of clothing. All the
natives are bedecked with amulets. They are very
lazy and obtrusive. One of them came to the captain
and begged for money. The latter said to him,
"Look here, you do nothing, so you have no money."
The nigger fired back, "You have lots of money&mdash;do
you do anything?"</p>

<p>There are few Europeans here, and very few
elderly ones among them. After they have passed
their youth here they leave the colony. The climate
is said to be bad. An epidemic of yellow fever is
raging. You may imagine that it is impossible to
buy fruit.</p>

<p>The niggers to whom we threw coins into the
water are already selling them, offering them back to
the officers, as Russian money is not accepted here.</p>

<p>Many of the natives are rather picturesquely
dressed in white and coloured tunics. The niggers
go about with sunshades, but all are barelegged.
The negresses sometimes wear European hats and
garments something like dressing gowns. They
carry their babies on their backs. Arabs are also
to be met with here.</p>

<p>The religions are Catholic, Mohammedan, and
idolatrous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>What a trade the town is doing since the
fleet anchored! Many articles are doubled in
value, and others cannot be obtained. The
post-office is original. The clerks (niggers) sit in
the building, and the public stand in the street
and transact business with them through the
windows.</p>

<p><i>November 3rd.</i>&mdash;I have been all over the fleet
this morning. I went on board the <i>Donskoi</i>,
<i>Oslyabya</i>, <i>Alexander</i>, and <i>Borodino</i>. About 3 p.m.
we weighed anchor. I do not know if we are
going to Gaboon. There is news here that the
storming of Port Arthur on October 20th was
repulsed with heavy losses to the Japanese.</p>

<p><i>November 4th.</i>&mdash;I went to bed early last night,
leaving my port open. Early this morning, when
they were scrubbing decks, water came in on to the
table and sprinkled me a little. I jumped up and
closed the port.</p>

<p>Last night they changed from one means of
steering to another, for practice, in the <i>Suvaroff</i>.
Something in her was not adjusted, and she very
nearly rammed the <i>Orel</i>. Thank God all passed off
successfully.</p>

<p>9 p.m.&mdash;The wardroom officers bought some birds
at Dakar, but did not buy food for them. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
fed them with anything they could find, and now
they are beginning to die.</p>

<p>Usually the band plays at lunch on holidays.
To-day they suddenly began playing at dinner.</p>

<p>At meals we drink more than we eat. We suffer
from dreadful thirst and drink pure water, mineral
waters, red and white wine, beer, and different kinds
of lemon juices. The admiral suffers most of all
from the heat. During the coaling, when all doors
and ports were closed, the temperature in his cabin
reached 45° R. There are now 27° in my cabin,
with the port open and the fans going which drive
in the fresh air.</p>

<p>Some of the officers have bought themselves mats
and sleep on them in the wardroom. The crew
sleep on the upper deck.</p>

<p>Last night something happened to the engines
of the transport <i>Malay</i>. All the fleet stopped and
waited for her.</p>

<p>About 4 a.m. the <i>Donskoi</i> signalled that sand
had got into her Kingston valves. That means the
ship had passed a shallow spot, although the fleet
was steaming 90 versts (sixty miles) from land. After
the mishap to the <i>Donskoi</i> they went further out
to sea.</p>

<p>It will doubtless be very hot to-day. Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
know, the floor of my cabin is so hot that I can
feel it through the soles of my boots.</p>

<p>7 p.m.&mdash;What awful heat! Again I have to keep
the port closed, as the sea is splashing in.</p>

<p>One of the <i>Borodino's</i> engines is damaged. We
stopped and waited for her. She is now steaming
with one engine.</p>

<p>Storms are visible passing away from us in three
places. The clouds are black and lightning flashes.
It is close.</p>

<p><i>November 7th.</i>&mdash;Something is wrong with the
<i>Borodino</i>. The other engine does not work now.
She gets hot bearings from time to time. We all
stopped and waited for her. We are losing time
over all these mishaps, and are losing it needlessly.
The cruise of our fleet round Africa has no precedent
in history.</p>

<p>Only by 8 a.m. did the <i>Borodino</i> put right her
engines. The fleet is now pursuing its customary
way.</p>

<p>7 p.m.&mdash;I saw two whales for the first time
yesterday. There is nothing to look at except sea
and sky.</p>

<p>Sometimes the men on watch collapse from
the heat and have to be carried below. There
are 61° R.  at the top of the engine-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
compartment, and we have not yet passed the
hottest place.</p>

<p>They are preparing to celebrate the crossing of
the line. The ceremony usually takes the form of
a play given by the crew, and the immersion of all
those who are crossing the line for the first time.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes ago something happened to our
dynamo engine, and all the electric lights went out.
The ship was steeped in absolute darkness. Now
all is repaired.</p>

<p>My servant has just brought a white tunic and
trousers, which he washed himself. They have
turned out very well. "I don't think a washerwoman
could have done it better," he said. "There
is one drawback&mdash;they are not starched. But no
matter; that's a trifle."</p>

<p><i>November 8th</i> (11 p.m.).&mdash;As soon as ever night
falls the same old story begins. From 8 p.m. until
now the fleet stopped. We are only going at five
knots. The unfortunate <i>Malay</i> has again delayed
us. Something broke in her engine and the pump
refused to work. I am very anxious about her. At
Dakar she sprang a leak. I saw it, and reported
that she could proceed without danger, working her
pump. Just imagine it! The only pump she has
is broken. She has nothing with which she can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
get rid of the water, and there are no docks near.
At the present moment the <i>Roland</i> is towing the
<i>Malay</i>, as one of her engines is broken and a blade
of the screw of the other engine is broken off.
Briefly, the <i>Malay</i> is unable to steam by herself.
We are still far from Gaboon. Again there is a
great delay. Thank God the sea is calm! If it
were rough, the <i>Malay's</i> situation would be very
dangerous. As it was, the <i>Roland</i> took a long time
passing the tow-rope to her.</p>

<p><i>November 9th</i>.&mdash;The <i>Roland</i> is still towing the
<i>Malay</i>. As soon as they are able to coal her, she
will be sent back. She will not then hinder and
delay us.</p>

<p>When we were at lunch to-day they signalled to
the admiral, saying that the <i>Kamchatka</i> had gone
out of her course and signalled, "Dangerously
damaged. Cannot proceed." Luckily, it turned
out that the damage was trifling, and she was able
to continue.</p>

<p>What a number of changes in climate we shall
have had if we reach Vladivostok! We left Russia
in very cold weather. Gradually it became hotter
and hotter, till the heat was intense; then it will
become cold again; then hot; and finally it will be
very cold, as we shall reach Vladivostok in winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p><i>November 10th</i> (night).&mdash;Again a bother with the
<i>Borodino</i>. Something went wrong with her machinery.
It was soon put right, but, nevertheless, time
was lost over it. The <i>Malay</i> is still being towed.</p>

<p>Have found out about Gaboon. The fleet will
not go within thirty versts of it.</p>

<p>All communications with Gaboon will be <i>viâ</i> the
<i>Roland</i>. Of course, no one will be allowed to land,
and we shall all kick our heels on board. Our ships
cannot go nearer, owing to shallows and banks.</p>

<p>The <i>Meteor</i> signalled to-day that one of her stokers
has struck work and refuses to keep up the necessary
amount of steam. The captain asked to be allowed
to deal with him himself. The crew of the <i>Meteor</i>
are volunteers.</p>

<p>I have been sitting all day long over plans and
calculations. The scuttles were open, and now and
then waves came splashing over my table. I went
to the ship's ice-chamber, and it seemed cold to me
after the heat which reigns everywhere.</p>

<p>The day passed strangely. I hardly went out of
my cabin, and got through a lot of work. I must go
and air myself, as my head has grown heavy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

CROSSING THE LINE</h2>


<p><i>November 13th</i> (10 p.m.).&mdash;<i>Off Gaboon.</i></p>

<p>This is how it has all turned out! We stopped
this morning and anchored. No one knows where
we are or where Gaboon lies. We have sent the
<i>Roland</i> north to the coast to find a lighthouse and
Gaboon. We see land, but the place is unknown.</p>

<p>I caught a glimpse of a shark. When we were
weighing anchor at Dakar, a cutter approached with
some important documents (perhaps it was the post).
In the hurry of departure the papers were not taken
on board.</p>

<p>The navigators, including the flagship's navigator,
were confused. It proved that we were thirty miles
(fifty versts) below Gaboon. We are now going
back to Gaboon, and we shall have already twice
crossed the Equator. The celebrations only take
place at the first crossing. When we strike the Cape
of Good Hope we shall have crossed it a third time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>6 p.m.&mdash;We are anchored. A French boat has
just arrived bringing some dispatches. In coming
the boat was nearly stove in, as it caught in our
wake. Luckily it escaped, and only the rudder was
broken.</p>

<p>The rats are making themselves felt. Three
nights ago a rat bit the first lieutenant in the foot,
and last night gnawed off one of his corns. What
do you think of that?</p>

<p>The French officer dined with the admiral. He
does not know what is going on at the war. Even
the telegraphic agencies' telegrams are not received at
Gaboon. A fine town this! And there are many
like it in the colony. I don't think we should find
a town like it in Russia. Not even the governor
of this place gets telegrams. There are only about
seven hundred Europeans here; the rest are negroes,
amongst whom are cannibals. During the last two
months the cannibals have eaten two Europeans.</p>

<p>They say that an English steamer will arrive to-morrow,
bringing us newspapers of October 27th
(Old Style). On the 16th or 17th the steamer will
go back to Europe, taking our mails.</p>

<p>As we have no news from the war, the wardroom
officers of the <i>Suvaroff</i> have asked the admiral permission
to send a prepaid telegram to the <i>Novoe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Vremya</i>, asking for news. The admiral refused
the request, but will wire to Admiral Wirenius,
who will send us the latest intelligence from the
Far East.</p>

<p>The admiral has received a telegram from Petersburg
advising him not to stop at Gaboon, but go to
some other place, as the French wish our fleet to
leave this port. They point out a more convenient
bay, and promise to give us pilots. Nevertheless,
our fleet will stay here as long as necessary.</p>

<p>What was the end of the shooting affair in the
German Ocean, near Hull?</p>

<p>They say the astonishment of the local Europeans
is very great. First one steamer arrived "for
provisions," then a second, then a third, and finally
our fleet. No one ever expected that we should
call at Gaboon. It is just as well, perhaps. The
more our movements are known, the more unfavourable
orders we might have from the French
Government.</p>

<p><i>November 14th</i> (11 a.m.).&mdash;Have already been on
board the <i>Orel</i> and <i>Alexander</i>. At two o'clock shall
go on board the <i>Nachimoff</i>, <i>Borodino</i>, and <i>Meteor</i>,
which are badly damaged and leak.</p>

<p>The Governor has sent us a present of fruit and
vegetables. At lunch we had pineapples, bananas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
mangoes, and something else. Pineapples are the
nicest.</p>

<p>On board the <i>Alexander</i> they accidentally carried
off a negro from Dakar, whom they have landed.
He says the negroes here eat their dead, as cattle
are scarce and meat is dear. Before they eat them
they cut off the hands and feet and put them in a
bog to swell. The flesh is then more tender and
tasty.</p>

<p>They do not risk sending divers down here, as
there are too many sharks.</p>

<p>The Governor sent some other fruits besides.
No one knows what they are&mdash;either grass or
vegetables. They have received a telegram in the
private transports saying that Kuropatkin has
driven the Japanese back to the coast. That
would be good news, but it is difficult to believe.</p>

<p>11 p.m.&mdash;The vegetation here is very rich, judging
by the reports of those who have been ashore.
A "regular botanical garden." A moth flew on
board&mdash;such a size, I am afraid you will not believe
me, but it was nearly a foot! We saw a turtle in
the sea, 2&frac12; feet long. The Frenchmen on shore
showed us a dead boa-constrictor 18 feet long.</p>

<p>The officers who went ashore called on the king
of the place. He was asleep. They woke him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
without ceremony, looked at him and his wife, and
went away. He is just a wild nigger, like his subjects.</p>

<p>I told you about the vegetables the Governor
sent us. We tipped the man who brought them a
pound sterling. He seemed much confused, accepted
the money, and then did not know what to do with
it. I think he will spend it on our wounded.</p>

<p><i>November 15th.</i>&mdash;They say there was a very
violent storm last night. I heard nothing, and
slept through it all.</p>

<p>The officers have returned from Libreville, where
they went at nine this morning. They relate many
interesting things, and are in rapture over the
vegetation. They have brought some fruit and a
couple of parrots. They bought one of the parrots
for ten francs, and the other was sent to the admiral
by a Jesuit father with the fruit, as a gift.</p>

<p>The same man who was given the pound, out of
kindness acted as guide to the officers. When
taking leave he feared a repetition of the tip, and
kept on repeating that "he wanted nothing."</p>

<p>The officers paid another visit to the king. He
received them in an English naval uniform and
cocked hat. They were photographed with him
and his wives. One of them was taken arm-in-arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
with the queen-dowager, who begged for money.
Some of the court ladies were drunk. It is two
days since the king, who is seventy-two, succeeded
his brother on the throne. Margarita, the eldest
lady-in-waiting and a most energetic old negress,
runs about naked. For that matter, the inhabitants
in general do not trouble about completeness of
costume. The natives respectfully greet all Europeans.
It is a curious monarchy, under the protection
of France; more truly it is her colony.</p>

<p>To-morrow there will be something in the nature
of a coronation on shore. The dead king is at
present lying in a box under lock and key. One of
the officers sat on this box, to the consternation of
the present king and his court minister. The
latter was dressed in a cocked hat, a necktie round
his bare neck, cuffs, sword, and frock-coat, but
without linen or trousers&mdash;a beautiful figure, thus
attired, at the reception of the guests.</p>

<p><i>November 15th.</i>&mdash;You can imagine what sort of a
town is Libreville. The Governor sent the admiral
the latest news from the papers. They are dated
October 2nd&mdash;the day of our departure from
Libau.</p>

<p><i>November 16th.</i>&mdash;I did not succeed in finishing
my last letter, as the boat left for the shore. In it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
went the last post which can go by the steamer
leaving for Europe to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>From sunset to dawn the admiral has forbidden
communication between the ships and the shore.
Yesterday at 10 p.m. a cutter from the <i>Donskoi</i>,
in the harbour without special leave from the admiral,
was detained. The officer of the watch was put
under arrest for this for three days. This evening a
boat from the same ship with three officers, also in
the harbour without special leave from the admiral,
was likewise detained. In to-day's orders the captain
of the <i>Donskoi</i> is reprimanded, and the three officers
who were in the boat are to be tried. They are to
be dismissed to the steamer leaving here for Europe
to-morrow and will go to Russia. As you see,
disobedience is severely punished on board.</p>

<p>9 p.m.&mdash;To-day a sub-lieutenant of the <i>Alexander</i>
told me about the negro whom they took from
Dakar. When his boat shoved off from the
<i>Alexander</i> he began to storm, shout threats and
curses at the boatmen, stamp on the deck with
his bare feet, etc. When he saw that he could
not get away from the <i>Alexander</i> he sat on the
turret and wept burning tears. The crew surrounded
him and looked on, laughing at this
healthy, bellowing lad. Seeing that there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
nothing to be done, he grew resigned. It appeared
he was very jealous and uneasy about his wife.
Very soon the crew made friends with him, and
taught him several Russian words. His memory
was phenomenal; in a few days he learnt the names
of nearly half the crew. The soles of his feet
seemed very funny to the sailors. They are half
white, as they are in all negroes. On the trip the
officers collected 60 roubles for him. He left
exceedingly satisfied. He serves in a shop, and,
being rather civilised, speaks French fluently.</p>

<p><i>November 17th</i> (7 p.m.).&mdash;Half an hour ago I
returned from the shore, where I had gone in the
<i>Roland</i>.</p>

<p>We reached Libreville at 8 a.m. About ten we
reached the town, if this settlement can be so called.
We could not approach close to it in the <i>Roland</i>, so
got into boats. I went with the officers of the
<i>Borodino</i>, and was with them all the time. First
we went to a restaurant for refreshment. There
were six of us. They gave us three bottles of
lemonade, a little bread, fish, meat, peas, cheese,
and fruit, and charged fifty-five francs. We left the
restaurant and went along an avenue of palm-trees.
We went to a German factory, to the Catholic
Church, to two or three little villages, and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
plantations. There was not much time, and we
turned back. We called on the king, then went
to a shop, then to the quay and back to the <i>Roland</i>.
Although I was only five hours ashore, I was fairly
tired, probably from not being accustomed to
exercise. Several photographs of our party were
taken. We were taken with the negroes serving
in the French army, with negresses in the villages,
in the plantation, and in the King's ground under
a tree with a small negress who ran after us.</p>

<p>The king came out and placed a chair for each
of us, and sat down in an armchair on the terrace.
He and all his courtiers were dressed. A nigger
all covered with grass and with a semblance of a mask
over his face (not the slightest bit of his body could
be seen) danced a Tam-tam, accompanied by savage
music. Our time was short. We rose, and the
king shook hands with us all. By this time many
officers had gathered at his palace. They wandered
into all the corners of his house. The dowager-queen
sat in a hammock drunk, and tearfully
begged for money. While rambling through the
plantations I bought a lot of pineapples, bananas,
and cocoa-nuts.</p>

<p>The plantation where we sat eating fruit belongs
to a Frenchwoman, a native of this place. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
thought her house was a restaurant, and unceremoniously
demanded lemonade, water, etc. It
then appeared that it was a private dwelling. The
Frenchwoman was very friendly&mdash;told us about
herself and her children, who were being educated
in France. She sent two negroes to carry our
purchases to the pier.</p>

<p>How rich the vegetation is in this place! You
seem to be walking in a botanical garden. All
around are palms, bananas, lemons, mimosa, lianas,
mangoes, baobabs, and wonderful flowers. The
trees are immense and lofty.</p>

<p>On our return we called at a shop for drink. They
gave us cider. If you had been here, what would
you not have bought! We purchased all sorts of
rubbish&mdash;negro instruments, teeth of wild animals,
poisoned spears, weapons, etc. In the town we met
the negro who was brought by the <i>Alexander</i>. He
now answers to the name of "Andrew Andrewitch,"
which was given him by the crew.</p>

<p><i>November 18th.</i>&mdash;I woke early this morning. I
had a trip to make to the private transports.</p>

<p>5 p.m.&mdash;Leaving Gaboon.</p>

<p>About an hour ago we weighed anchor. Our
destination is unknown.</p>

<p>To-day on board the <i>Alexander</i>, which is astern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of the <i>Suvaroff</i>, they celebrated the crossing of the
line. We could see how they capered and splashed
water about. In the <i>Orel</i> something has happened
to the electrical steering gear, but she is steaming
and does not detain the fleet.</p>

<p><i>November 19th.</i>&mdash;At 9 a.m. we began to celebrate
crossing the line on board. Neptune, Venus, a
navigator, sub-lieutenants, Russian peasant-women,
devils, barbers, and tritons arrived on field gun-carriages
drawn by black naked people. All this
fine company came from the stern of the ship,
accompanied by buglers and to the sound of a
march, played by the band, which was stationed
forward. They approached the fore-turret and
climbed on to it. The audience took up their places
in the bows, on the bridges, turrets, masts, yards,
and crosstrees. The admiral, captain, and officers
stood on the bridge. The actors were all half naked,
and were painted in the most varied colours&mdash;black,
green, red, yellow, blue, etc. Neptune had his
trident and a great beard of tow. The navigator
had a chronometer, binoculars, and a sextant. The
peasant-woman had a baby, which was represented
by the fox-terrier. When the baby was supposed
to cry, they twisted the dog's tail to make him
howl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The actors played well. Near the turret was a
huge bath, made of canvas and filled with water.
When the play was over, they turned the hose on to
every one, from the admiral down to the sailors.
The actors were first thrown into the bath, and then
the rest of the ship's company. After being ducked,
their faces were lathered with a huge brush dipped
in whiting, and they were shaved with a very large
razor (two and a half feet long), made very cleverly
from a piece of wood. The water in the bath was
clean at the beginning, but after the actors who were
painted had been ducked, it turned into God knows
what colour. Nearly all the officers, the captain, and
the flag-captain were ducked and shaved. I and
several others escaped the bath; nevertheless, I had
not a dry spot on me. Any one who hid was hunted
out and ducked. The messman shut himself up in
his cabin. They could not get at him, so they removed
the deck-plate above it and poured water in.
The messman at last, to save his things, came out and
was thrown into the bath. Even the chaplain did
not escape the same fate. It was a good thing for
those who fell in feet foremost. When it happened
the other way, their heads were pushed under and
their legs held up. One of the dogs who was thrown
into the water climbed out on to the nearest bitts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and looking at the people struggling near him, raised
a deafening howl.</p>

<p>The crew evidently enjoyed their holiday. It was
a great diversion for them, as they had not been
ashore since we left Revel.</p>

<p>About four o'clock something went wrong in the
<i>Malay</i>. An officer was sent to replace the captain.
All the fleet stopped for the transfer of the officer
from the <i>Suvaroff</i> to the <i>Malay</i>.</p>

<p>The fleet is now going to Great Fish Bay, which
belongs to Portugal. If for any reason we cannot
call there, we shall steer for Angra Pequena (under
the protection of Germany).</p>

<p><i>November 20th</i> (7 p.m.).&mdash;We had vespers on
board. The service pleases me, especially in the
ship. Though around one are only the faces of
officers and men all dressed in white, and though
the acolytes and choir are barefooted, the chants
and intoning remind me of dear, far-distant Russia.</p>

<p><i>November 21st.</i>&mdash;It is beginning to be less hot.
The greatest heat, or more correctly closeness, was
at Dakar. Now it is fairly tolerable. When we
reach the Cape of Good Hope we shall have to put
on ordinary uniform, and perhaps greatcoats. They
say it will be very hot and damp in the Indian
Ocean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>All the crews in the fleet have begun to fast, by
order of the admiral. Do you know how they fast?
They eat their food as usual, only they go to church.</p>

<p>If the reckonings are correct, and all goes smoothly,
then by the end of January or the beginning of
February our fleet will be near the shores of Japan.
This will mean that there will be only about two
months more of the wearisome, monotonous life
which we are all leading. It will not be long before
we join the ships that went by the other way.
Much depends on the position of the Port Arthur
and Vladivostok fleets, as well as of Port Arthur
and Vladivostok themselves. It also depends on
how matters stand with Kuropatkin at the time of
our arrival in the East.</p>

<p>Judging by descriptions, Great Fish Bay is not
an important place. The settlement consists of
seven houses, two of which are uninhabited. It
is surrounded by the desert. There is no water,
so it has to be brought from a distance. Fish are
plentiful. It is a very good anchorage. We
shall probably be there to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>It is cooler now. In my cabin there are 24° R.
The drawers of the table can be pulled out once
more.</p>

<p><i>November 23rd.</i>&mdash;The temperature continues to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
fall. In the open at present there are only 14° R.
They count on arriving at the anchorage at twelve
o'clock. We are now going further from Port
Arthur, but after doubling the Cape shall approach it.
The voyage from Tangier to Port Arthur is about
the same as the voyage from the Cape to Port
Arthur. What a much longer distance we have
come by going round Africa!</p>

<p>1.50 p.m.&mdash;We have arrived at Great Fish Bay.
It is not particularly pretty. On one side the shore
is high and jagged, and on the other it is flat. There
are small houses in several places on the low-lying
shore. From the ship they can hardly be seen,
even with a telescope. The shore is sandy. No
doubt there is neither post nor telegraph station
here. Wherever one looks there is sand&mdash;nothing
but sand.</p>

<p>A Portuguese gunboat has just passed the <i>Suvaroff</i>.
(Her name is <i>Limpopo</i>.) She is a very small and
insignificant ship. She was anchored far out in the
bay, and has now gone no doubt to acquaint the
authorities that our fleet has arrived and anchored
at Great Fish Bay.</p>

<p>This will be a surprise for the Portuguese. We
do not, however, stay here for long. To-morrow
evening we get up anchor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>4 p.m.&mdash;It appears that the Portuguese gunboat,
<i>Limpopo</i>, went round the fleet and stopped near the
<i>Suvaroff</i>. Her captain came to the admiral with
explanations. I do not yet know what he said,
but it can be nothing pleasant for us. Yesterday,
before the fleet arrived, the gunboat compelled one
of our colliers to put to sea under a threat of firing
on her. The moment the fleet arrived the colliers
re-occupied the places assigned them by the admiral.
They say the admiral assured the commander of
the Portuguese gunboat&mdash;or, more correctly, led
him to suppose&mdash;that the fleet was four miles
from the shore; that is, that it was in neutral
waters.</p>

<p>Amongst other things, the Portuguese stated that
it was known that our ships would call at Great
Fish Bay. Curious how this could have been known
at Lisbon, where the arrangement to send a man-of-war
here was made. Probably they were informed
by the English, who jealously watch every
movement of our fleet. The hospital-ship <i>Orel</i> has
left, and will call at Capetown.</p>

<p>We shall go to Angra Pequena from here. The
Germans (to whom it belongs) call it Lubevitz Bay.
It is situated one thousand versts from here. We
leave this to-morrow at two o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p><i>November 23rd.</i>&mdash;At anchor in Great Fish Bay.
An hour ago I gave my letter to you to be sent to
Europe by one of the steamers that is returning.
The captains of the steamers had been on shore.
They say that the beach is strewn with lovely shells
and crowded with red flamingoes. The captain of
the Portuguese gunboat told the captains of the
colliers that he would forbid any attempt on their
part to coal the fleet. What naïveté&mdash;or rather,
what impudence!</p>

<p>I have ordered them to call me at 6 a.m. to-morrow,
in order to go to several ships.</p>

<p><i>November 24th.</i>&mdash;From Great Fish Bay to Angra
Pequena. I could not sit down and write to you all
day. Somehow, everything went wrong. Just as I
seated myself I was called away. I was on board
the <i>Borodino</i> to-day. I saw some Libreville photographs.
They are very small; you cannot make
out the faces.</p>

<p>At four o'clock all our fleet began to weigh anchor.
Two hours later the <i>Malay</i> hoisted a signal that
something had happened to her rudder. The <i>Roland</i>
was ordered to take her in tow. The hospital-ship
<i>Orel</i> is also going with us. Whales and albatrosses
are seen more and more frequently. The albatrosses
fly a tremendous distance from the land, and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
very large; sometimes they measure sixteen to
seventeen feet across the wings.</p>

<p>Life on board is monotonous. One day is like
another. You live in the past (at all events, I do),
and dream of the future.</p>

<p><i>November 27th.</i>&mdash;We passed the Tropic of Capricorn
to-day. We are approaching Angra Pequena.
We have lessened speed, in order to get there in the
morning. The flagship's navigator considers that
half our voyage will have been completed when we
reach the southern end of Madagascar.</p>

<p>At Angra Pequena I think we shall get news
from the East. The Germans are probably more
interested in the war than the French.</p>

<p>A sailor in the transport <i>Korea</i> has been seized
with dysentery or malaria. God grant that the
disease does not spread. Hygienic conditions are
disregarded in the fleet. Many go on the sick-list.
The wind has risen, the waves have increased.
Before entering Angra Pequena boats will be lowered
and will take soundings. The place is little known.
Some ships might go aground. The post has
already been collected. I hope to be able to send
this letter to-morrow morning.</p>

<p><i>November 28th.</i>&mdash;Approaching Angra Pequena.</p>

<p>We have not yet reached the anchorage. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
are steaming very slowly, for fear of going aground.
The wind is still increasing, and the waves are
dashing over the poop (the after-part of the upper
deck). Even if the weather gets no worse our cruise
round the Cape will not be a very happy one.</p>

<p><i>At anchor at Angra Pequena.</i></p>

<p>About one o'clock we reached Angra Pequena.
The battleships anchored, but the cruisers remained
at sea. There is not much room in the bay. It is
impossible to stand on deck in unsheltered places.
It blows fearfully. The waves are washing over
everywhere. No boats have been lowered yet.
There is no communication with the shore, or even
between ships. The post has not been sent. You
may imagine what the strength of the wind is when
it is estimated at a force of ten.</p>

<p>Report says that the mail-boats call here five
times a year. Possibly one of the colliers will be
discharged, and return to Europe from here. In
that case the mail will be sent in her.</p>

<p><i>November 29th.</i>&mdash;The wind abated a little during
the night. A steamer came alongside, but the sea
was so high that her side was crushed. One of our
75-millimetre guns was damaged, and a port was
broken, which will have to be repaired or changed.
Spare guns are carried in the transport.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the third day that the mail-boat has been
detained owing to the weather. We hear, from
English sources, that there has been a fight at
Mukden; the losses on both sides amount to 50,000
men. It is also said that the Japanese have taken
by storm one of the forts at Port Arthur. The
Russians blew up this fort, and 30,000 Japanese
perished. All this is hearsay.</p>

<p>On shore they say that a certain steamer puts
to sea every night and watches passing vessels.
Evidently this steamer is freighted by the Japanese,
to follow and perhaps strike a blow at our fleet.</p>

<p>Men are going out of their minds in the fleet.
An ensign of the reserve serving in the battleship
<i>Orel</i> went mad, and also a sailor in the transport
<i>Korea</i>.</p>

<p>An English steamer arrived here and left at once.
A German transport arrived with troops to put
down the native rising in the interior. The mail
apparently was not sent, and the mail-boat has
already left. Perhaps they will be able to send it
by the troopship, which is probably returning to
Europe. Everything, as you see, is uncertain. We
stop on and on here for no reason. It is still blowing
hard. There is no communication between ships,
and I ought to go on board the <i>Malay</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p><i>November 30th.</i>&mdash;We remain at anchor.</p>

<p>Every precaution is taken. Searchlights illumine
the horizon.</p>

<p>Close to the fleet are two small islands belonging
to England. It is perfectly astounding&mdash;wherever
you look on the map there are English
possessions, although they are small. Angra
Pequena formerly belonged to England. She ceded
it to Germany, but the two islands remained in
her possession.</p>

<p>Wherever we have called, the local authorities
(some, perhaps, only outwardly) placed impediments
in the way of our fleet. Angra Pequena
is the first German port at which we have called,
and the authorities are very friendly.</p>

<p>The local commandant says that "he is not a
diplomat, and he does not know officially of the
arrival of the Russian ships. They are anchored
behind a bend, and are not visible from his windows."</p>

<p>I forget that Denmark also put no obstacles in
our way; but, judging by the tales of those who
have been in Denmark, the Danish people sympathise
with Japan, and not with us. The Government
involuntarily helps Russia. It is quite
different with Germany. The sympathy of both
people and Government is on our side. I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
know how it will be later, but at present we have
nothing to reproach the Germans with.</p>

<p>We do not know when our stay here will
end. An English (Capetown) newspaper has been
brought on board. Sad news! Kuropatkin has
not moved, and according to the paper he received
a reinforcement of 34,000 men after the battle of
Liao-Yang. Can it really have been so few? The
commander of the second army has only just arrived
at Harbin&mdash;which means that the army is
not yet in being. We learn that Kaulbars is appointed
commander of the third army; he is said
to be a very incapable general. At Port Arthur
the Japanese have taken a hill that commands all
the harbour. The ships are at a disadvantage, and
they are hurriedly preparing to go to sea. This
is the news imparted by an English paper. How
sad it all is!</p>

<p>Officers who have been to the post-office on shore
found out that only ten Europeans&mdash;Germans&mdash;live
in the settlement. They saw the troops sent
out from Europe by Germany to subdue the natives.
There are 1,200 men. Two of the German officers
speak Russian, one of them excellently. There is
general hatred of England here as well. She
supplies with arms the natives whom the Germans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
are now going to subdue. She is evidently a
country that tries to damage every one and to work
mischief everywhere.</p>

<p>The wind is still howling. We are waiting for
it to go down. At our anchorage there is mishap
after mishap. The <i>Malay</i> and the <i>Meteor</i> have just
signalled that their engines are so badly damaged
that they cannot repair them without help. The
co-operation of the <i>Kamchatka</i> is necessary, but I
could not go on board.</p>

<p><i>December 1st.</i>&mdash;Yesterday from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m.
I was going from one ship to another in a steam-cutter.
What a time I had! The cutter pitched
and rolled violently. She dipped her bows under
and shipped large quantities of water. It was
difficult to see because the salt spray blinded one.
Sometimes the cutter pitched so much that her
screw was out of the water and raced. To complete
our discomfort, it was quite dark.</p>

<p>After I had been to several ships I had to go to the
<i>Kamchatka</i>. We could not discover where she was
in the darkness. We searched for her. She was
lying further from the shore than the other ships. It
is difficult to describe what it was like near her.
It seemed impossible not only to go on board her,
but also to receive a bag which was lowered over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
her side. I had on a mackintosh, but there was not
a dry spot on me. How was I to get on board?
It was pure torture. It was impossible to go
alongside the ship without the risk of breaking up
the cutter, which was absolutely prancing on the
water. There was no accommodation-ladder, so
we had to get up by a rope-ladder, choosing a
favourable moment. God help you if hand or foot
slipped. You would either fall between the ship
and the cutter and be crushed, or be struck by the
screw if it were moving, or run the risk of falling into
the jaws of a shark. Yesterday an officer fell like
this, but luckily escaped with only a ducking. I
again ran the risk of falling into the sea when going
on board the <i>Malay</i>. I had only just seized hold
of a rope when the cutter was torn from under my
feet. I hung over the water, but got on board
somehow. I shall not forget yesterday in a hurry.</p>

<p>To-day it is nearly calm.</p>

<p>Calm! I had to go to the steamer <i>Ratzentaler</i>;
she was damaged. I reached her safely and examined
her. This took me about an hour. I came
up from below to get into the boat, and this "thing"
called the sea was as boisterous as ever. With
difficulty I let myself down into the cutter. She
rolled and capered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, when shoving off, the screw
fouled a rope, passed from the steamer. The position
was critical, but fortunately the rope broke,
and with great care, by going very slowly, we
reached the <i>Suvaroff</i>. Some one remarked, as I
was dangling on the rope-ladder, choosing the
moment to jump into the boat, "If only your wife
could see you in that position!" I was not in any
actual danger.</p>

<p>The Governor lunched with the admiral to-day.
He came on board in the <i>Alert</i>, a small steamer.
He says that such winds are usual here.</p>

<p>If you only knew how sick I am of my surroundings!
They say our cruise is a specially trying
one; it has prejudiced me against the "beautiful"
sea for ever. God grant that it end successfully!
They will not entice me on board a sea-going ship
again for a very long time. I have had enough of
the sea&mdash;being torn away from home, living under
unnatural conditions, everlasting surprises in the
shape of breakages, damages, and repairs, dirt everywhere.
You must not be surprised if I sometimes
write ill-naturedly. My nerves are shaken a
little, which is not surprising under the circumstances.</p>

<p><i>December 2nd.</i>&mdash;To-day, for the first time, I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
cormorants swimming at sea; I also saw a jellyfish.</p>

<p>The officer commanding the German expedition
and the commander of the native troops came to
call on the admiral. The latter did not return the
call himself, but sent the flag-captain. The <i>Orel</i>
has lost an anchor and forty fathoms of cable.
They are now grappling for them, as it was decided
not to send down divers for fear of sharks.</p>

<p><i>December 3rd.</i>&mdash;In the <i>Kamchatka</i> they obtained
an English paper from a collier, in which it is
related that the Japanese attacked the part of our
fleet that is going <i>viâ</i> the Suez Canal, in or near
the Red Sea. Our ships apparently received some
damages. Perhaps this is a newspaper yarn. The
<i>Roland</i> went to sea yesterday, to bury the body of
a sailor who died in the <i>Korea</i>.</p>

<p>An order has been issued that we are to steam
without any lights, in absolute darkness. Hitherto
all lights were put out except distinctive lights&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
those absolutely necessary to show we are steaming.
Now these are forbidden.</p>

<p>It is settled that we leave here to-morrow morning
early.</p>

<p>What surprises are in store for us on the way
to Madagascar? That there will be some is beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
doubt. I have been running round to-day like a
squirrel in a cage. I went to the <i>Orel</i> and <i>Alexander</i>,
and was, as usual, a long time in the <i>Borodino</i>.</p>

<p>The first lieutenant fell into a coal-shoot, hurt
his leg, and is now laid up. It is very strange, whenever
I go on board the <i>Borodino</i> my spirits go up. I
have noticed this more than once, and it is always
with pleasure that I go on board her.</p>

<p>Boats from every ship helped the <i>Orel</i> to search
for her anchor and cable. They only found them
to-day at three o'clock. They had, after all, to
send divers down several times.</p>

<p><i>December 4th.</i>&mdash;I have not slept well the last few
days. I am inclined to sleep, but it is impossible
to lie down. The rats have greatly increased on
board. However, they afford a certain amount of
fun. The dog Flagmansky (this name was given
him because he came on board the same day as the
staff) found a rat in one of the cabins, and chased
it into a cupboard. Several men took an active
part in the chase. All this time Flagmansky barked,
whined, rushed into the corners, scratched at the
cupboard, and bit it.</p>

<p>The hunt was not crowned with success, and he
is still in the cabin guarding the rat. The cur has
an extraordinary passion for rats. I put him into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
my cabin once (he begged to go there), and repented.
He made such a disgraceful noise. For an hour
and a half I could not drag him away. I had to
call the orderly, who with great difficulty pulled
him away from the cupboard.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

ON THE WAY TO MADAGASCAR</h2>


<p><i>December 4th.</i>&mdash;From Angra Pequena to Madagascar.</p>

<p>I only went to bed at 4 a.m., and rose at
8 a.m. We prepared to leave here at dawn, but
at 1.30 a thick fog came on and continued till 9.30.
As soon as it dispersed, the fleet weighed anchor.
In the night a schooner came and lay near the
fleet. The officer of the guard went on board.
She is flying the English flag, and says she has come
here for guano. Our next anchorage is at Madagascar,
near the small island of St. Mary. This island
lies near the north-eastern shores of Madagascar.</p>

<p><i>December 5th.</i>&mdash;There was a short mass to-day.</p>

<p>A steamer was perceived far off going in our
direction. Her funnel and two masts could only
be seen from our masts. Perhaps she has come
from St. Helena, and we may expect a surprise. At
first she was noticed by the smoke from her funnel.
She is now, no doubt, following us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Something has happened to the <i>Aurora's</i> engines,
but she has repaired it by now. To-day the <i>Suvaroff</i>
steamed with one engine for a quarter of an
hour.</p>

<p>Even the <i>Malay</i>, which has to be constantly
nursed, is steaming successfully now. I expect
several repairs were made when she was at Angra
Pequena.</p>

<p>8 p.m.&mdash;The steamer which is on our course,
though far away, overtook the fleet and went in
the direction of Capetown.</p>

<p><i>December 6th.</i>&mdash;To-day is December 6th. Where
have I not spent this day? In Cronstadt, in Petersburg,
in Tzarskoe Selo, in Tashkend, and in Gothland
aboard the <i>Poltava</i>. Now I am spending it
near the Cape of Good Hope. Who would believe
that they would spend St. Nicholas Day near the
southern coast of Africa? There was mass, prayers,
and a salute. If foreigners heard it, no doubt it
will appear in the papers that there was a fight, as
firing had been heard.</p>

<p>We have not yet reached the Cape of Good Hope.
We are just steaming past Capetown. Table
Mountain is visible. The swell is tremendous.
The ships are rolling. It is fearful to look at the
<i>Nachimoff</i> and <i>Donskoi</i>, which are rolling especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
heavily. The height of the waves sometimes reaches
seventy feet. I was told this by the flag navigating
officer. If we double the Cape in safety,
then thanks be to God.</p>

<p>They have arranged a game for the crew. They
hang up a bucket of water with a board attached
to it, in which there is a hole. Those playing have,
in passing under the bucket, to thrust a stick through
the hole. This they seldom succeed in doing.
Usually the stick hits the board, and the bucket is
turned over, spilling the water on the player. The
players are driven under the bucket on a field gun-carriage.</p>

<p>We are steaming near the shore. It is hilly,
dark, and treeless. Table Mountain is distinguished
by its height and its summit, which is flat, as if
the top of the mountain were cut off; this is apparently
why it got its name. The Cape of Good Hope
is a shapeless pile of cliffs. There is a lighthouse.
We have now passed this cape and Capetown.
To-night we shall be off Cape Agulhas. When
we have passed it we shall have left the Atlantic
and entered the Indian Ocean. We shall be able
to say, one ocean passed; two more remain, the
Indian and the Pacific. As the crow flies we are
now at the greatest distance from Petersburg. Up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to the present we have been going away from Japan,
now we begin to approach. Near Capetown we
met an enormous four-masted ship, flying the
American flag. She was coming towards us. We
are expecting to meet three suspicious schooners.</p>

<p>The weather is getting worse. In two hours we
shall be on the same meridian as Petersburg; our
time will be the same as it is there&mdash;that is, midnight.
After this Petersburg time will be behind ours;
hitherto it has been before. Evidently you cannot
double the Cape without very bad weather. Perhaps
it is all for the best, as it will be more difficult for the
suspicious schooners to commit any hostile action.</p>

<p>Astern of the fleet and on the same course there
is a steamer. At first she showed lights, now they
are not visible. The moon is shining, but will
soon set, and it will be quite dark. This will be the
time to expect any unpleasant occurrences.</p>

<p>I hear the admiral does not want to take the
small torpedo-boats with him, among them being
the <i>Rezvy</i> (Sportive). Perhaps some of the officers
of these boats will be transferred to other ships.
It has been decided that the transports <i>Malay</i>
and <i>Kniaz Gortchakoff</i> are to return to Russia from
Madagascar. Their engines are bad, and have to
be nursed continually.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>All the fleet and auxiliary cruisers will assemble
at Madagascar.</p>

<p>The same steamer is astern of us; she has her
lights out. It is not merely out of curiosity she
does this.</p>

<p>At first I used to be disturbed by reports of this
kind, but am no longer. No doubt it is rather
alarming, but nothing like it was before. How
can this be explained? Nerves a little blunted,
perhaps. It is summer here now. Nevertheless,
at this time of the year ice sometimes drifts from
the antarctic regions. They say a mountain of ice
100 feet above the water floated to the shore in
summer-time.</p>

<p><i>December 7th.</i>&mdash;Just as I sat down at table I was
called away. It causes an unpleasant sensation
when the engines race&mdash;that is, when the screws
suddenly begin to turn very much quicker. This
happens when there is no water over them, and is
caused by the vessel pitching heavily; consequently,
there is no resistance to their turning.</p>

<p>The steamer which has been following us all along
is not to be seen. Perhaps towards night she will
show herself somewhere. The wind has got up and
raised a big sea. The sea is a following one. Great
mountains of water pour on the upper deck. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
ship is beginning to roll more heavily; we may expect
a gale towards night if the wind strengthens. It is
a good thing it is not a head sea&mdash;the ship steams
more easily and does not roll so heavily. There is
a lot of water on the deck in my cabin, as well as
in other people's. I am now sitting with my legs
huddled up. The water comes into the cabins
through badly closed ports and badly riveted sides.
The waves sometimes hit the side and make a noise
like a shot from a gun. The weather is so bad that
we need have no fear of being followed by the
Japanese. They could no doubt attempt to fire a
torpedo from the steamer, but it could hardly hit,
and the steamer would certainly be fired on and
sunk.</p>

<p>The battleships <i>Suvaroff</i>, <i>Alexander</i>, <i>Borodino</i>, and
<i>Orel</i> have many defects which could be remedied
in the construction of the <i>Slava</i> (Glory).</p>

<p><i>December 8th</i>.&mdash;The weather was such yesterday
that God grant we do not experience it a second
time. Early in the morning it was tolerable, but
later on the wind began to freshen. Standing on
deck was difficult. The waves grew larger and
larger&mdash;like immensely steep hills round the ship.
They attained a height of forty feet.</p>

<p>From three to four o'clock the fury of the gale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
reached its height. I am not sufficiently eloquent
to describe it all. The ship tossed and groaned
complainingly. Everything was tightly shut, but
water came in everywhere. It poured in cascades
on the upper deck, went into the turrets, stokeholds,
engine room, conning tower, and even on to
the bridge. You could not walk on the poop, or
you would be washed overboard. You could not
breathe in the cabins; the atmosphere was like a
bath (steam), if not worse. The wind roared, the
ship rolled. The waves came up quite vertically&mdash;you
looked and saw a wall of water. A boat
which hung at the davits was smashed to bits,
torn away, and carried off to sea.</p>

<p>Astern of the <i>Suvaroff</i> came the <i>Alexander</i>; at
times, when the sea lifted the latter, her ram was
visible. Sometimes her bows were at the bottom of
a wave, and her stern at the top; and then all her
deck, from bow to stern, could be seen from the
<i>Suvaroff</i>. When I saw this I could not at first
believe it. The best-behaved ship was the <i>Borodino</i>;
she is a ship to be proud of.</p>

<p>At last the weather got to such a pitch that, had
the engines or rudder of any ship given way, she
would have been in a hopeless position. To think
of help from other vessels would be useless. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
this time each ship only thought of herself. The
steamer <i>Roland</i> was flooded with waves minute after
minute; she had to increase speed to escape them,
and disappeared out of sight of the fleet.</p>

<p>She rejoined to-day. Thank God it was a following
sea and a fair wind. What would it have been
had it been a head or beam wind?</p>

<p>At 5 p.m. something went wrong with the engines
of the <i>Malay</i>. She stopped and turned broadside
to the wind. If you could but see what a sad sight
she presented! It was impossible to help her, even
if she had gone to the bottom before the eyes of the
whole fleet. Nearly all the underwater part of her
was visible. Wave after wave rolled over her. To
help herself a little she set small and wretched sails.
They were no good. The whole fleet, without
lessening speed, went past the <i>Malay</i>, leaving her
to cope by herself with the broken engine and the
bad weather. Since then she has not been seen.
How does she fare? It is not known whether she
is afloat or sunk. We shall know nothing before we
get to Madagascar. Perhaps all will yet be well.</p>

<p>The Indian Ocean has not given us a very affable
reception. They were afraid that the wind would
get up to-day, but although it is fresh it is tolerable.
Storms such as we experienced yesterday last for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
fortnight without a break. Last night, when the
gale abated, rain squalls began to pass over us.
This pleasure was not continuous; besides, we were
wet enough without them. I went to bed late.
I had wandered all over the ship. Went to sleep
undressed. My feet had been wet through since the
morning. While at lunch yesterday in the admiral's
cabin a large wave rolled on to the upper deck; the
door leading to the poop from the cabin had not
been closed, and a cascade of water poured in.
Every one raised their legs and kept them so until
sailors had dried up the water. This wave was one
of the first to fall on the ship.</p>

<p>What weather! You seldom see the like! I
wrote to you that we had passed the meridian of
Petersburg. I was mistaken. We only passed it
to-day at 8 a.m.</p>

<p><i>December 9th.</i>&mdash;The weather is gradually mending.
The ship rolls lightly.</p>

<p>In the <i>Suvaroff</i> the cook and the messman were
French. The messman left the ship at Vigo, and
the former cook became messman. Every one
grumbled at him. At last it was decided to get rid
of him. One of the officers undertook to superintend
the cooking. The messman will be put on
shore at Madagascar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Thanks to the favouring gale and fair wind we
shall, it appears, reach Madagascar considerably
earlier than was anticipated.</p>

<p><i>December 10th.</i>&mdash;The weather is nearly quite calm,
although the ship is still rolling slightly. At 8.30
the <i>Borodino</i> left the line. Something went wrong
with her steering gear. She has not left the fleet,
but is steaming alongside it. Now she has repaired
the damage.</p>

<p>There are about 1,400 miles more to St. Mary,
our next anchorage. Under favourable conditions
we should arrive there in six or seven days. We
shall get the mails and newspapers there. No news
has been received about the <i>Malay</i>, though they
call her up by signal in the evenings. If she has not
suffered shipwreck, she must be far from the fleet.
Her speed is inconsiderable. We shall learn her
fate at Madagascar.</p>

<p><i>December 11th.</i>&mdash;During the night on board the
<i>Suvaroff</i> the coal in the bunker caught fire. The
fire was speedily extinguished with steam, which
was injected into the bunker.</p>

<p>There is only a slight wind to-day, but the deadly
swell continues. It is impossible to open the ports.
Yesterday they brought my cap-covers from the
wash. They are so torn now I can hardly wear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
them. You cannot imagine what a barbarous wash-house
we have. They bring back the linen torn
and stained. No matter how strong a material
your tunic is made of, they tear it.</p>

<p>The <i>Orel</i> left the line, having damaged her steering
engine; but she quickly set it right and resumed
her place.</p>

<p>Just before the colours were lowered to-day a
cloud appeared on the horizon, like smoke. They
thought it was the <i>Malay</i> overtaking us. Our
excitement appeared to have been needless. The
<i>Kamchatka</i> complained of bad coal; she could not
keep up sufficient steam, and began to drop astern.
Her captain, by signal, asked permission to throw
overboard some 150 tons of bad coal. The admiral,
seeing in the fall of steam the work of some evil-disposed
persons, refused, but gave permission to
throw overboard the wrongdoer.</p>

<p>No sooner is the tale of the <i>Kamchatka</i> ended
than the <i>Suvaroff</i> lies motionless, having damaged
her steering engine. It was repaired somehow, and
we proceeded.</p>

<p><i>December 12th.</i>&mdash;A curious thing happened last
night. They were communicating with the <i>Kamchatka</i>
by signal. She hoisted a signal about her
speed. The ship's signalmen interpreted the signal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
thus, "Do you see the torpedo-boats?" The
officer of the watch sent down to wake all officers,
and tell them that a torpedo-boat attack was imminent.
Buglers and drummers were stationed to sound
off quarters for action. There was general alarm.</p>

<p>A strong wind is beginning to blow. I hope it
will not turn into a gale again, as it does not bring
much joy. When you are ashore you pay no
attention to the weather, whereas now you attentively
follow its strength and direction. If nothing
happens, there are four days' journey left to our
anchorage in Madagascar. Up to the present we
have come quicker than was intended. The storm
on the eighth of the month helped us. At Madagascar
the cruiser <i>Kuban</i> will probably join the
fleet. She left Russia after we did. She outstripped
us, and we have not yet seen her.</p>

<p>Probably at that island we shall be joined by
the ships going by the Suez Canal. The weather
is apparently about to get worse. The waves are
again increasing. In the Atlantic it is calm; in
the Indian Ocean it is always boisterous. They say
that from Madagascar on it will be quieter. God
grant it! It is impossible even for a minute to open
one's port to let fresh air into the cabin. The
artificial ventilation is very feeble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p><i>December 13th.</i>&mdash;Rain has fallen all to-day. The
transport <i>Meteor</i> for some reason began to drop
astern. (She is carrying fresh water. Although they
distil water in the battleships and cruisers, she is
nevertheless sometimes of assistance. She usually
provides the transports with water.) Like all the
other ships, she complains of the bad coal, with
which it is difficult to keep up a sufficient quantity
of steam for the boilers.</p>

<p>A storm has begun; the wind has suddenly
freshened. Some say that this is a local squall,
others that it is a cyclone. It is especially awkward
for ships to get into a cyclone if they happen to be
in its centre. Formerly sailing-ships that were
caught in the centre of a cyclone seldom escaped.
No doubt it is not so dangerous for steamships;
yet, all the same, it may cause discomfort enough.</p>

<p>To-night is very dark. Black clouds stretch over
the sky. The storm sometimes moves away, sometimes
approaches us.</p>

<p><i>December 14th.</i>&mdash;It was a cyclone yesterday; it
only caught us with its circumference. Until one
o'clock I was on deck. We are now passing along
the eastern shore of Madagascar, and about thirty
miles from it. The shore is clearly seen with the
naked eye. It is high and mountainous.  Just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
before twelve o'clock a steam-pipe burst in the
stokehold of the <i>Suvaroff</i>. The steam whistled and
began to pour into the stokehold. The men were
nearly scalded. Some of them fled into the bunker,
and shut the door behind them with the aid of a
stoker, who remained in the stokehold and found
a means of saving himself another way.</p>

<p><i>December 16th.</i>&mdash;Off the island of St. Mary.</p>

<p>They have brought news from the shore. Ay!
such news that the remembrance of it is nauseating.
All the ships at Port Arthur are destroyed. The
<i>Gromoboy</i> (Thunderer) has struck on the rocks.
Kuropatkin sits tight at Mukden and organises
parades. A third deep-sea fleet is leaving, or preparing
to leave, Libau. Can this be true? What
is all this? Are they joking, or have they quite
lost their heads? You cannot imagine how mortifying
it is. Everywhere are failures, corruption,
stupidity, and mistakes. No doubt you, living in
Petersburg, have heard all gradually. It all falls
on us as a sudden blow. Involuntarily you are
overwhelmed with horror. There is not one bright
spot; all around is hopeless darkness.</p>

<p>Yes, our affairs are bad, very bad!</p>

<p>The steamer <i>Roland</i> is going to the town of
Tamatave, which is about a hundred versts from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
our anchorage. The hospital-ship <i>Orel</i> arrived from
Capetown and brought newspapers. The officers of
the <i>Orel</i> say that in the streets of Capetown you
constantly hear Russian spoken; that is, by Jews
from Russia. There are some thirteen and a half
thousands of them. Many of them have fled from
Russia in order to escape their military obligations.
The Jews so besieged the <i>Orel</i>, wishing to look over
her, that at last the police had to drive them away
from the ship.</p>

<p><i>December 17th.</i>&mdash;The <i>Roland</i>, when coming out of
Tamatave, signalled that the <i>Malay</i> was coming in.
A schooner flying the Swiss flag has arrived here&mdash;schooner
of a country where there is no sea!</p>

<p>The <i>Malay</i> has arrived. It does not do to believe
all the news from the fleet. For instance, to-day a
telegram was sent <i>viâ</i> Tamatave, saying we had
coaled near Durban. Nothing of the kind occurred.
It was telegraphed to alarm the English and compel
them to institute an inquiry. In one word, to
make them show that they had not broken their
neutrality.</p>

<p>The <i>Orel</i> brought the captain of the <i>Suvaroff</i> the
<i>Novoe Vremya</i> (New Times) and <i>Birgevya Viedomosti</i>
(Bourse News) from Capetown. How eagerly we
read them!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Our fleet lies in the strait between the islands
of Madagascar and St. Mary. To-day we were
informed from St. Mary that two ships were lying
on the other side. Was it from these ships we received
signals? They suppose them to be Japanese
cruisers, and fear for the <i>Roland</i>. She has not returned.
If there are Japanese cruisers here they
might easily catch her and send her to the bottom.</p>

<p>It is very probable that the ships coming <i>viâ</i> Suez
are lying in the Mozambique Channel, off Madagascar
(near the western shore). As yet we have no news
of them.</p>

<p><i>December 18th.</i>&mdash;To-day the admiral and several
officers of his staff went to the island of St. Mary.
I did not want to go, so did not take advantage of
the opportunity. The steamer <i>Esperanza</i>, which is
bringing provisions for the fleet, has not yet arrived.
She had to call at Capetown, and then follow us
here. Perhaps we shall remain off the island here
for a prolonged time. Evidently the term of our
stay depends on the answer to the telegram sent
to Petersburg.</p>

<p>To-morrow a steamer arrives (French), and leaves
on the 21st, taking the mails.</p>

<p>The <i>Roland</i> has not yet returned. Where the
rest of the ships are is not known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>The question of the return to Russia of the <i>Malay</i>
is definitely settled. She is to go to the Black Sea.
Her stores will be taken in the other transports.
She goes from here <i>viâ</i> the Suez Canal, taking the
sick and feeble from the fleet. That will be one
burden the less.</p>

<p><i>December 19th.</i>&mdash;I have been to St. Mary to-day.
The trip began by our scarcely reaching the shore.
It was rough, and a head sea began to pour over
the cutter. I was wet through, and cursed myself
for coming.</p>

<p>The scenery here is very little different from
Gaboon and Dakar. There is the same rich
tropical growth. The types of inhabitants are
different. The people here dress more than those
at Gaboon, and appear well built. The population
does not enjoy the confidence of the French, and the
soldiers are taken from another place. Not long
ago the natives killed two European officers in
Madagascar. When our fleet arrived, they thought
we had come to punish them for the murders, and
several settlements ran away. St. Mary is a
Sagalien for Madagascar. There are two prisons&mdash;one
for political offenders, the other for capital offenders.
What strikes one generally about the negroes
is their gait. They walk holding themselves upright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>I wandered about on shore, was in the village,
and looked into the church (Roman Catholic). It
is the new year to-day, according to the New Style.
The population are dressed in their holiday clothes.
I bought six very pretty shells in the village for a
franc. Strolling along the beach I collected fifty
shells&mdash;one large one of six to eight inches diameter.
My walk along the beach was poisoned by anticipation
of having to row back to the ship, which, with
the others, lies very far from the shore.</p>

<p>I went on board the ship, and there was a surprise
for me&mdash;to go to the <i>Esperanza</i>, which had only
just arrived. The weather had already grown
much rougher. Two Frenchmen have come aboard
the <i>Suvaroff</i>, and they cannot get ashore; they
will have to spend the night here. The sailors from
their boat are negroes, and have been sent to sleep
with the crew, whose chance guests afford them
amusement.</p>

<p>In the morning the <i>Roland</i> arrived, and brought
the news that they had seen a suspicious schooner
and a destroyer (Japanese). They saw Admiral
Folkersham's fleet (which came by Suez) had
gone to Nosi Be. No answer had been received
at Tamatave from Petersburg. A French steamer
will bring us the answer to-morrow. At Tamatave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the French gave our officers a friendly reception.
On the occasion of the arrival of the Russian fleet
they even printed the menus with the double-headed
eagle and our flags.</p>

<p><i>December 20th.</i>&mdash;I was called early this morning.
I have to go to the <i>Esperanza</i> again. I am wet
through, and have to change my clothes and boots.
It is a good thing that those I wore yesterday have
dried. The Frenchmen have gone and taken with
them the letters and telegrams to give to the steamer.
I missed the dispatch of letters owing to the trip to
the <i>Esperanza</i>.</p>

<p>Our fleet will soon shift its anchorage. We shall
hardly go to Nosi Be. It is awkward to lie there,
and the bay is shallow for battleships and also
for transports. The refrigerator in the <i>Esperanza</i>,
which cools the air in the holds where the meat
is stowed, is damaged. This is unfortunate; the
meat will go bad, and we shall have to feed on
salt meat.</p>

<p>At four o'clock the steamer <i>Pernosbucco</i> arrived
here; she brought no news from Petersburg. At
seven she left for Diego Suarez. To-morrow we get
up anchor and go north to some bay.</p>

<p>A stoker died on board the <i>Oslyabya</i>; he was buried
at five o'clock to-day. The <i>Oslyabya</i> left the line,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
half-masted her colours, fired her guns (a salute),
and committed the body to the sea. During this
ceremony the officers and crews of all the ships
stood at "attention," and where there were bands
they played "Kol Slaven."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>To-day the wireless station received some signals,
evidently sent from a great distance. None of the
ships could decipher them&mdash;it was not known, even,
in what language they were written. To-morrow
I shall learn whether it was not one of our newly
arrived ships that signalled.</p>

<p><i>December 21st.</i>&mdash;In the bay of Tang-tang.</p>

<p>This morning we weighed and shifted from St.
Mary nearer to Madagascar, in the bay of Tang-tang.
It is better protected than where we were lying.</p>

<p>The guns are ready at any minute to commence
firing. In all corners of the ship are men talking
in undertones. They anxiously scan the horizon.
The outlines of the nearest ships stand out in black
silhouettes. At the sides the torpedo-nets are rocked
by the waves. The searchlights are ready to
instantly illuminate all around. The tension is
felt, though there is absolute stillness. Every one
is chilled by fearful anticipation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>
<p><i>December 22nd.</i>&mdash;To-day the cruiser <i>Kuban</i> is
expected to arrive, and to-morrow the squadron
that came <i>viâ</i> Suez.</p>

<p>In the English newspapers there is an announcement
that Russia has ordered thirty ships of various
kinds in Germany and Italy.</p>

<p>Those undeciphered signals which our wireless
stations received have been made out by some one
in the <i>Nachimoff</i>. The signal was Japanese. It
stated that "the Russian fleet is lying without
lights off the island of St. Mary." To-day a French
officer commanding some local troops arrived, and
spent the night on board the <i>Suvaroff</i>. The torpedo-nets
were again got out; the crews were at their
guns; steam and mining cutters lay near their ships,
one-third of the officers were on deck by order, and
a large number out of curiosity.</p>

<p>The night was rather dark&mdash;half the sky was
covered with clouds. Occasionally sparks of light
glimmer here and there. Some one is signalling.
A light flashes on shore; it is answered from the
sea. The <i>Aurora</i> reports that she saw six lights
astern of her. I myself saw four out at sea and
one on shore. What will to-night bring us? An
attack must be expected. Everything is so unusual.
All lights are hidden. At dawn a cruiser is
leaving with secret orders, apparently for the colliers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p><i>December 23rd.</i>&mdash;The <i>Malay</i>, which remained at
our former anchorage, has not yet reached the fleet.
The cruisers have gone. The <i>Roland</i> has not yet
returned. The <i>Kuban</i> is not here, nor the squadron
from Suez. To-night there was a long story from
the <i>Esperanza</i>, which is cruising under the French
flag and has a French crew. The crew, not liking
to lie at anchor without lights during the night,
threatened the captain. These brave Frenchmen
feared an attack. The <i>Esperanza</i> has now been sent
away somewhere. A collier arrived bringing some
information, thanks to which we shall leave here
to-morrow&mdash;whither I do not yet know.</p>

<p>Evening.&mdash;The <i>Kuban</i>, it appears, is lying at
Diego Suarez, and the ships from Suez at Nosi Be,
where we are also going to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>December 24th.</i>&mdash;Port Arthur has surrendered.
What more can be said?</p>

<p>On the way to Nosi Be from Tang-tang.</p>

<p>The sad news of the surrender of Port Arthur
was brought by the <i>Roland</i>. She arrived to-day.</p>

<p>On the 24th the cruiser <i>Svietlana</i> and the torpedo-boats
<i>Biedovy</i> and <i>Bodry</i> joined the fleet. The
latter damaged her engines, and was at once taken
in tow by the <i>Roland</i>. The same day we met two
colliers. They were ordered to go to Nosi Be. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the 25th the <i>Bodry</i> reported that she had very little
coal. The fleet stopped, and the <i>Bodry</i> took coal
from the <i>Anadir</i>, going alongside her.</p>

<p>It is a good thing it was calm, and this could be
done without risk of damage. Yesterday there was
mass and prayers. It is really Christmas. After
mass the admiral made a short but impressive speech
to the crew. All the ships saluted according to
regulation. They fired thirty-one guns.</p>

<p>In the evening the <i>Borodino</i> reported by semaphore
that shortly before sunset four large warships
were visible from her masts, steaming in line ahead.
Afterwards three of the ships turned and disappeared.
Lights were burning on the remaining
ship. After a short time, they made out that this
ship, having put out her lights, altered course and
also disappeared. There is evidence that there
are Japanese warships off Madagascar. The night
passed in alarms. Some lights were visible away
from our course. Attacks were feared. Instructions
were given to the battleships and transports what
to do during an attack.</p>

<p>The cruiser <i>Svietlana</i> was sent to the squadron
lying in Nosi Be.</p>

<p>I could not sleep from the closeness in my cabin.
Until 6 a.m. I slept in my clothes on a sofa in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
wardroom. At 6 I went back to my cabin and
opened the port. The sea wetted the table and
fell on to the bed, but that afforded nothing but
pleasure. It does not even wake you.</p>

<p>This morning we got into communication by
wireless with the <i>Svietlana</i>, which is ahead of the
fleet, while she was in communication with the
squadron at Nosi Be. It appears that our cruisers
<i>Aurora</i>, <i>Donskoi</i>, and <i>Nachimoff</i> are lying there.
Yesterday it was supposed that the ships seen in
line ahead were these cruisers and the <i>Kuban</i>,
which joined them from Diego Suarez. Now this
supposition falls to the ground.</p>

<p>We are going by a spot seldom explored
and not sounded. Occasionally shallow places are
shown on the chart, and the fairway along which
we are steaming is very narrow; the depth is
unknown&mdash;it has not been measured. We may
go aground.</p>

<p>To-day I finished writing those reports about the
battleships <i>Borodino</i>, <i>Orel</i>, <i>Imperator Alexander III.</i>,
and <i>Kniaz Suvaroff</i>, which I began long ago. I
must touch them up a little and send them to Petersburg.
Many will be dissatisfied with them, and
probably I shall make enemies for myself. No
matter. Having once decided on it, I must carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
it out&mdash;the more so as it appears to me the remarks
will be very useful.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock the torpedo-boat <i>Buiny</i> (Boisterous)
approached, coming from Nosi Be. All is well
there. The torpedo-boat offered to escort the
hospital-ship <i>Orel</i> to the anchorage. At present
our fleet is thirty miles from the anchorage. Owing
to the dangerous entrance, we shall remain at sea
all night, and go in to-morrow morning. Tossing
on the sea all night with the transports is not without
danger.</p>

<p><i>December 27th.</i>&mdash;The fleet is steaming slowly,
turning constantly in order not to be too far off
Nosi Be. At 2 p.m. the <i>Roland</i> hoisted a signal,
"The crew have mutinied." The torpedo-boat
<i>Biedovy</i> was ordered to reduce the mutineers to
submission, and if necessary to shoot them. The
torpedo-boat, with such full powers, soon re-established
order. It appeared that the stokers did not
wish to take the place of two sick comrades, and
hence the whole story.</p>

<p>I hardly slept all night. Went to bed at four and
got up at seven. We are approaching our anchorage.
What news awaits us? After the destruction
of the fleet and the fall of Port Arthur, affairs are
radically changed. There is now no need for haste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>There are three courses open to our fleet&mdash;either
to continue the voyage to the East, to remain
for an indefinite time in some place in the expectation
that its presence will be necessary on the
coast of Japan, or to return to Russia. If we are
obliged to remain somewhere and wait, will the
admiral remain in the fleet? And if he goes, what
fate may his staff expect?</p>

<p>I had just sat down and busied myself when
I heard the sound of my beloved Little Russian
march. I looked out of my port and saw we
had arrived at Nosi Be. I ran on deck and saw
a wonderful picture. The bay, the calm sea,
hills all round&mdash;two of the latter especially, covered
with a thick wood, stand at the entrance opposite
each other. The sun is scorching. In
the bay are the remains of the naval might of
our unfortunate fatherland. The sounds of the
march re-echo. We have rejoined all the ships
that we parted from at Tangier more than two
months ago. Here are all that are left to Russia.
Can it be that they will be ingloriously and ignominiously
destroyed? The fleet is still strong
enough, but is it efficient? There were more
ships, and they are battered to pieces or lie at the
bottom of the sea. Can it be that our fleet will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
complete the great tragedy of the ruin of an immense
navy?</p>

<p>The meeting of our admiral and Admiral Folkersham
was very hearty. They embraced. You cannot
recognise the men in the boats of Admiral
Folkersham's division. They are all in sun helmets,
whereas our men have put neck-covers on their
caps. Admirals Folkersham and Enquist were
invited to lunch. They learnt the news. All are
sad.</p>

<p>There is neither telegraph nor post here.
Torpedo-boats go to Mayung (Mojanga) in order to
send the mails and telegrams. It is about 200
versts from here. There are few Europeans. We
hear occasional newspaper reports which we do not
know how to believe. One is perfectly terrible.
Port Arthur surrendered with a garrison of more
than 40,000 men, among whom were 1,000 officers.
It is simply incredible! The triumph of the
Japanese is complete; they will raise our ships
that were sunk in Port Arthur harbour, and
leaving them their former names, will fight in
them against us.</p>

<p>Admiral Folkersham says there are no mails
or letters from Russia. He telegraphed twice to
our staff requesting them to send on letters. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
did not even reply. What is it to them, sitting
snugly in Petersburg, that more than 850 officers
alone have no news from home for two months?
It is all the same to them! They are all right, and
as regards others it is not their business.</p>

<p>They do not count on taking the transports
<i>Gortchakoff</i> and <i>Malay</i> any further, but will send
them to Russia from here. It is said that, according
to the first order, the fleet is to leave Madagascar
on January 1st. The captain of the torpedo-boat
<i>Buiny</i> has come. There are several breakages and
defects in this boat. I shall have to go to-morrow
morning and make arrangements for their repair.</p>

<p>We have a tremendous voyage before us&mdash;across
the Indian Ocean, calling nowhere. Under favourable
conditions we shall get to the East Indian
Archipelago in twenty days, and then Japan is quite
close. What will it be? Can the fate of the
Port Arthur fleet await us? It is said that Nosi
Be is extraordinarily like the harbour of Nagasaki.
It is not possible to remain in one's cabin. The
deck is so hot that you can feel the heat through
the soles of your boots.</p>

<p>The cyclone that overtook us on the way to
Madagascar apparently caused much damage in
this island. Thank God that we came happily out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of it. The cruise in the ships that came <i>viâ</i> Suez
was much easier than ours. They called at well-constructed
ports. The voyage was shorter. Officers
and men were frequently allowed ashore. Our
fleet accomplished a tremendous voyage, calling
at a few deserted bays. The crew were not allowed
on shore, and the officers seldom had permission
to land. It is said permission to land will be given
to-morrow. It does not attract me; the shore is
wild and deserted.</p>

<p>To-night I can sleep with my port open. I shall
be able to breathe. I must go to bed early. It is
already late, and to-morrow I must get up early,
and dash round the ships. At present there are
few damages. Perhaps they have not been able to
report them. I shall see to-morrow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

AT MADAGASCAR</h2>


<p><i>December 28th.</i>&mdash;Since early this morning I have
been visiting ships. Here is a description of life
in a torpedo-boat,&mdash;crowded, dirty, hot, and always
rolling; the decks littered with various things,
the crew sleeping in every corner. Dogs are crowded
together, and in several boats there are monkeys.
There is nowhere to walk. The crew&mdash;good, resolute,
bold, and crafty&mdash;are crowded with the officers,
but do not inconvenience them.</p>

<p>I called on the <i>Borodino</i> and went into the
wardroom and captain's cabin. During the last
voyage they got up theatricals for the amusement
of the crew. They were very successful. The
clowns especially excelled; they say they were as
good as professionals.</p>

<p>The sun here scorches one severely. I descended
from the <i>Kamchatka</i>, sat on the wooden thwart of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the cutter, and jumped up quickly&mdash;I had burnt
myself.</p>

<p><i>December 29th.</i>&mdash;To-day from 12.30 I was on
shore with the captain, buying wood. We were at
a German factory, and I asked the Germans to send
a letter when opportunity offered. I think they
may be depended on.</p>

<p>Letter No. 74 was sent by collier to Port Said,
where the mail will be handed over to the Consul,
and he will dispatch them to the staff, who will
forward them to the addresses&mdash;a lengthy procedure.
A steamer has arrived with provisions
(the <i>Esperanza</i>).</p>

<p>On shore I saw a negro suffering from the so-called
elephantiasis. His legs were swollen, and were
as thick as wooden posts. The disease only attacks
negroes and Malays.</p>

<p>I wonder what telegrams the admiral has received?
A French torpedo-boat brought some
service telegrams, as well as private ones, from
Mayung (Mojanga). The former are, of course, in
cipher. They are deciphering them now.</p>

<p>My servant has just come to ask me to change
his Russian money for French money. I gave him
five francs. There is very little foreign money in
the fleet, and great trouble in changing Russian. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
decision as to the fate of our fleet has been received
from Petersburg. They are silent&mdash;perhaps they are
consulting.</p>

<p>Three officers have been discharged from the
fleet: an ensign who went mad, a lieutenant
through illness, and the paymaster of the <i>Aurora</i>.
A court of inquiry has been appointed to survey
the transports <i>Malay</i> and <i>Kniaz Gortchakoff</i>,
which are being sent to Russia. I am one of
the members. I wanted to go ashore to-morrow,
but shall not be able, owing to this inquiry. It is
very trying, having to remain waiting the decision
of the fate of the fleet from Petersburg.</p>

<p><i>December 30th.</i>&mdash;I was unable to finish my letter
yesterday, as I was sent to the <i>Borodino</i>. I went
there at twelve, midnight. An unfortunate accident
occurred. Two sailors went into the wing passage
and were suffocated, although the manhole was
open. The closeness in these passages is frightful&mdash;there
is little air, and poisonous gases accumulate.
The sailors, in my opinion, became weak, could
not lift themselves up the ladder, fell, struck their
heads on something, and were suffocated. They
wanted to make a post-mortem on the deceased,
but did not do so.</p>

<p>I passed the night in the <i>Borodino</i>, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
admiral's dining-cabin on a sofa. At six I got
up, having slept for two or three hours. They
provided me with a mat and a pillow. It was
fearfully hot and stuffy, although the doors and
ports were open. The heat is unbearable. You
are always wet with perspiration. Yesterday I
saw a case of sickness from the heat. A writer
was taken ill at night, though it was cooler then
than in the day.</p>

<p>A sailor in the <i>Suvaroff</i> was also nearly suffocated
in the wing passage. Sunstrokes are frequent. I
called this morning at the <i>Suvaroff</i>, and was immediately
sent on board the <i>Malay</i> for the inquiry.
While there I was twice sent for by the admiral.
He wrote a severe order about the death of the two
sailors in the <i>Borodino</i>. He ordered me to add to
this order some technical details. Taking advantage
of this, I toned the order down as much as I could
in sending it to be printed.</p>

<p>At four o'clock the dead sailors from the <i>Borodino</i>
were buried. The admiral was present at the requiem
service. Their bodies were taken in a boat to the
torpedo-boat <i>Bravy</i>. She took them further out
to sea and committed them to the deep. It was
a sad ceremony. When the cutter shoved off from
the <i>Borodino</i> with the bodies, they fired guns; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
band played the funeral march, "Kol Slaven."
The officers and crews of all the ships stood at
"attention."</p>

<p>Phew! how stuffy! I can scarcely write. In the
<i>Borodino</i> I saw that the officers, to escape the heat,
slept on deck among the coal, like the crew, undressed
and dirty. The beds of the officers are only distinguished
from those of the crew by being mats. When
I first saw this sleeping company I could hardly
believe my eyes.</p>

<p>What an unfortunate day it has been for the <i>Ural</i>!
In the morning a sailor had a sunstroke, and in the
evening two officers, an ensign and a lieutenant,
were struck by the traveller of the Temperley,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
which had carried away. The ensign was killed
on the spot&mdash;his chest was crushed and his spine
broken. There is still hope of saving the lieutenant.
He received a blow on the head, and fell down
unconscious; it may be he will pull through. It
is a strange thing about this lieutenant. He is a
Black Sea officer, and has only just come to the
<i>Ural</i>. He was sent from the Black Sea at half
an hour's notice to this cruiser. You see many
officers in the fleet, but his Black Sea cap (all white
with a peak) attracted the eye. He was on board
the <i>Suvaroff</i> an hour before the accident. They
induced him to remain; he was late for his watch;
but all the same, to his misfortune, he went to his
ship. When he came on board us he met some
comrades, told them a lot about the Black Sea
fleet, abused it and its personnel. I was sitting
near and was an involuntary listener. His stories
interested me. Abusing the personnel, he related
how three of his comrades with whom he lived
made an end of their lives. "See," he said, "I
lived with four comrades, and three of them have
put an end to their lives, and something of the
same kind will happen to me." He said this about
an hour before the accident. For a few minutes
before his departure I talked to him, and he told
me how he had come to the <i>Ural</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<p>There is a great talk in the wardroom now about
the <i>Suvaroff</i> being forbidden communication with
the shore, because a sailor was absent and they
made no attempt to find him. In every ship you
must look out for animals&mdash;parrots, monkeys,
oxen, chicken, geese, chameleons, frogs, pigs, and
dogs; in a word, every sort is collected together.
In one of the ships they brought a snake in the hay
for the cattle. It bit an engineer in the breast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
which swelled tremendously. They feared he would
die. Now he is all right; the swelling has subsided.</p>

<p>It is late; I must go and try to sleep. Haven't
slept much for the last two nights.</p>

<p><i>December 31st.</i>&mdash;There has been a great deal of
talk about the sending of money to Russia for the
crew. It cannot be managed. New Year's Eve
is on us, but the days are so much alike that no one
ever thought about it up to the present time.
The sailor who had sunstroke died, and after death
the temperature of his body was 43° R.</p>

<p>I had scarcely finished my letter when I had to
go in the cutter to the <i>Ural</i>. The <i>Ural</i> is one of
the steamers bought from the Germans. She is
very well finished. In the saloons are paintings,
gilt and carved decorations. She is very big.</p>

<p>I went below, and the requiem service began. I
shall not forget it soon. Here were joined luxury
and poverty, elegance and squalor. The church
is the former first-class saloon, now the wardroom,
turned into a shrine. Eight large fans made a
peculiar noise in quick time. A crowd of officers
were there, dressed in white. The choir sang almost
a gay chant&mdash;badly, but in tune; the priest helped
them. During the pauses the dull noise of the
fans was clearly heard. There were sentries on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
both sides of the coffin, which rested on a rude
table, not covered with anything. It was more
like a box than coffin, and had been made roughly
out of pine boards, badly painted. The wood
showed through the paint in streaks. During the
service they sewed the coffin up in white calico.
They could not find a whole piece, so added scraps.
The wreaths were composed of fresh flowers.</p>

<p>A sad spectacle. Apparently the ensign was not
killed by the traveller, but by the Temperley itself.
After the service the coffin was lowered into
the boat by the very Temperley that wrought the
accident. A steam cutter towed the boat to the
shore, and was followed by a long line of boats,
filled with the funeral party. When the coffin
was being lowered, they fired a gun, and all ships
put their ensigns at half-mast. The crews stood
at "attention," and the band played the funeral
march.</p>

<p>Two bands awaited the procession on shore;
they had accompanied the other dead man.
This was the sailor (from the same <i>Ural</i>) who died
from sunstroke. At the cemetery the funeral
service was read, the coffins lowered into the graves,
and the escort fired three volleys. Simple crosses
were erected, and then all dispersed. They left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
behind two Russians to lie in their graves, far from
their fatherland, among strangers, under simple
white crosses with a crooked and uneven superscription
roughly carved on them. Little did
they think that fate would send them death far
from Russia in a strange country, in the midst of
luxurious though foreign nature! Little did they
think that they would lie side by side&mdash;that both
would be buried in the same hour. Indeed, one
cannot escape fate.</p>

<p>Another sailor has gone mad in the <i>Orel</i>.</p>

<p>But enough of this....</p>

<p><i>January 1st.</i>&mdash;I left the wardroom at four o'clock.
Many remained and occupied themselves in drinking.
I returned on board the <i>Suvaroff</i> yesterday, in the
<i>Borodino's</i> boat.</p>

<p>The population of Nosi Be is a mixed one. You
may meet negroes, Malays, Jews, Indians, and a
few Europeans. Horses are scarce, and you travel
in litters borne on the shoulders of men.</p>

<p>There are numerous breeds of monkeys, parrots,
lizards, crocodiles, etc.</p>

<p>Cattle are plentiful; the oxen have humps, and
immense horns. Yesterday a scene occurred with
the oxen! When the funeral procession came up
to the cart, to which oxen were harnessed, the band<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
was playing. The oxen were frightened and ran
wild. One tore himself away from the yoke and
charged the firing-party following the coffin, with
lowered horns. A catastrophe was narrowly
averted. They soon succeeded in driving him
away. The other struggled for a long while in
the yoke, and at last got free.</p>

<p>Chosen officers are going from each ship to all
the others with congratulations. It is evident that
they will return to their ships late, and not quite
themselves. They are treated generously, and
offence is taken if they drink too little.</p>

<p>A torpedo-boat has arrived from Mojanga with
telegrams; some are cipher telegrams from Petersburg&mdash;they
have not yet read them. There is news
that the <i>Oleg</i> passed through the Suez Canal on
the 31st. If that is so, she may arrive here on the
22nd inst.</p>

<p>Am just going round the ships.</p>

<p><i>January 2nd.</i>&mdash;The <i>Kuban</i> has arrived. To-morrow
I may go on board her. I have journeyed
somewhat to-day. After lunch I went to the <i>Aurora</i>,
<i>Nachimoff</i>, <i>Jemchug</i>, <i>Sissoi</i>, and <i>Voronej</i>. The
latter belongs to the volunteer fleet. On board
her I procured a thousand cigarettes for ten
roubles. I was much pleased with this. In going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
on board the <i>Aurora</i> I lost the top of my helmet.
It acted as a ventilator, and cannot be replaced.
I must go about without it.</p>

<p>Several of us, I among the number, have prickly
heat. It is not very disquieting, but at the same
time does not afford any pleasure. In the <i>Jemchug</i>,
where I have not been since Libau, they did not
recognise me. I am so changed in face, owing
to my beard.</p>

<p>We remain here, and know nothing of when and
where we are going. Probably we shall wait for
the <i>Oleg</i>, <i>Isumrud</i>, and torpedo-boats. Persistent
rumours are floating about that the fleet will return.
Letters have been received from Sevastopol with
very bad news. It is said that the sailors there
have mutinied and created much trouble. They
say there are serious disorders in Petersburg.</p>

<p>To-day I should have gone to some ships, but could
not, as all the boats were away for the exercise of
landing parties. Finished my work, "Notes on Ships
of the <i>Borodino</i> Type." Handed them into the office
to be typewritten. If it is true that we leave on
the 6th or 7th, I shall hardly be able to send them
to Petersburg. Can it be that we shall not wait
for the <i>Oleg</i> and other ships coming with her?
That would be idiotic! To stay quietly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
strengthen the fleet does not interfere with the
cruisers and torpedo-boats.</p>

<p><i>January 3rd.</i>&mdash;What a day it has been! I scarcely
got through lunch when, at two o'clock, I went
to the <i>Donskoi</i>, from there to the <i>Borodino</i>, and
then to the <i>Ural</i>. Have only just returned to the
<i>Suvaroff</i>, having had nothing to eat anywhere,
and now only bread-and-butter. It is a good
thing I fortified myself with chocolate. The <i>Ural</i>
is the former steamer <i>Queen Maria Theresa</i>. She
ran between Hamburg and America.</p>

<p>There are a lot of sick in the fleet; two belong
to the staff, the flag engineer and the flag intendant.
The senior auditor is sick, but is doing his duty.
It is the fault of this climate.</p>

<p><i>January 4th.</i>&mdash;I have been to the <i>Kuban</i>, which
was formerly a German passenger steamer and ran
across the Atlantic Ocean. She has all the conveniences
of life, is roomy and luxurious, but as a
warship the <i>Kuban</i>, like the other purchased ships,
is useless. She has few guns; their calibre is small,
and there is no armoured protection. All is wood.</p>

<p>More animals have made their appearance in the
ship. They have brought a hare, a porcupine, and
a dog off from the shore. Wherever you look now
you see birds, beasts, or vermin. On deck oxen are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
standing ready to be slaughtered for meat, to say
nothing of fowls, geese, and ducks. In the cabins
are monkeys, parrots, and chameleons.</p>

<p>Having scratched you a letter, I went to put it
with some postcards into the box. At the post-office
were crowds of people, hurrying to post letters to
catch the outgoing steamer. I scarcely waited to buy
stamps for the postcards. As stamps would stick
together while being kept, those having greater
values are not covered with gum. This is very
inconvenient, as you have not always gum at hand.
I had to buy some gum-arabic in a shop. Indians
are the principal shopkeepers here. Boys in the
street call out simple words of Russian, and frequently
repeat them. Profiting by the arrival of
the fleet, everything is dreadfully dear. They have
never before done such a roaring trade. One of the
places here has a high-sounding name&mdash;"Parisian
Café." The landlord of this café says that after
the departure of the fleet he will close it and go to
Paris. He will never earn more than now.</p>

<p>From the post-office I went to this café. They
persuaded me to play vint (Russian whist). Close
by were a lot of officers playing macao. They
play very high (during our stay at Nosi Be one
officer succeeded in losing more than £400&mdash;<i>i.e.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
4000 roubles). I did not sit down to play
macao; but just trifled with it, lost sixty francs,
and then went to the quay. It was time&mdash;just
six o'clock&mdash;and the boat was due to shove
off. By seven I was on board, having been on
shore less than four hours. On going into my
cabin I learnt some news. We leave on the 7th.
The post was sent by Günsburg. Whether we leave
Madagascar on the 7th, or are only going to
change our anchorage, I do not know. Either is
possible.</p>

<p><i>January 5th.</i>&mdash;I went on shore to-day. There
was a large crowd around the post-office, all Russians.
Some were posting letters, others buying stamps.
I thought I would go into a café to get a drink.
I asked for a bottle of soda-water with ice, and
squeezed a grenadine into it. For this they charged
four francs.</p>

<p>I left the café and went to the cemetery,
where the Russians and other Europeans were
buried, and sat there awhile. It is a poor place, all
overgrown. The memorial crosses are the only
white spots. Everything is sunk, hidden by the
tropical growth. It is almost a forest. Many birds
flutter about in the trees&mdash;some remarkably pretty,
with rich plumage of all colours. I saw a colibri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
there (the smallest bird in the world). I used to
think they were considerably smaller than they
actually are.</p>

<p>From the cemetery I returned to the post-office.
My companion lost all hope of posting
his letter, so many were waiting their turn. I
persuaded him to remain, and we managed to do
our business there. We went to the quay, but the
boat was not there. We had to wait, so, being
tormented by thirst, we went to the café. I drank
a bottle of lemonade, and my companion a bottle
of beer, and it cost four francs. A bottle of champagne
costs forty francs&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> about fifteen roubles.</p>

<p>In every corner of the café officers from the fleet
are sitting at tables and playing cards, vint and
macao. At three tables macao was being played
for heavy stakes. French officers from the torpedo
gunboat looked on in astonishment. I did not play.</p>

<p>Several men obtained riding-horses and mules&mdash;tired,
broken, and lean beasts. A large number of
officers from the <i>Borodino</i> walked through a virgin
forest, forcing their way through the lianas. They
made themselves very dirty. Two officers from the
<i>Suvaroff</i> went out shooting, but bagged nothing.
At seven o'clock I returned on board, fairly tired,
having walked nearly all day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p><i>January 6th.</i>&mdash;Although I was tired, I went to
bed last night at twelve. It rained all night. This
cooled our hot sides, which do not generally grow
cool during the night.</p>

<p>Now there are constant rain squalls. There was
mass, prayers, and the blessing of the water to-day.
The priest made a procession to sprinkle the ensign
and the jack.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> There was chicken pie for lunch,
but a very inferior one. The French torpedo-boat
again brought official telegrams. They have not
yet been deciphered: perhaps they contain something
interesting.</p>

<p><i>January 7th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday a steam cutter from the
<i>Donskoi</i> went aground. They got her off to-day.</p>

<p>A native came and complained that a boat from
the fleet had sunk his catamaran (native boat), in
which was a case of champagne, a case of rum, and
a box of lemons. He was probably indemnified.</p>

<p>I had just sat down to write when I was required
to go on board the <i>Jemchug</i>. Just returned.</p>

<p>The ladies' committee of the "Society to help the
Wounded" sent the admiral the ikon of St. George
"the Victorious," and fifty small crosses for the
officers and crew. I received a cross and hung it
to a chain with my own. It is very pretty, and
made of mother-of-pearl.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>
<p>The rainy season, which should have begun a
fortnight ago, was late. It has now begun&mdash;another
pleasure for us.</p>

<p>Many of the wardroom tumblers are broken.
They cannot be bought here. Jam-pots are used
instead.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine how the local traders
live. They have raised all prices considerably, and
continue to raise them.</p>

<p>The provision-ship <i>Esperanza</i> will no longer
accompany the fleet. I wanted to go ashore at
6 a.m. to-morrow with some one, to explore the
interior of the island; but it is impossible. An
inquiry is to be held in the <i>Malay</i> to survey the
coal left in her. I have to take a part in this
inquiry.</p>

<p>Again there are rumours that the fleet will leave
here on the 11th. I think this is only supposition.
The French mail-steamer leaves for Europe on the
9th. Perhaps this letter will be the last that will
go in her. There will then be a break in my letters.
Steamers do not often call here&mdash;only once or twice
a month.</p>

<p>Some chameleons were brought on board, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
have now spread all over the ship. They are harmless;
but to me, at all events, they are repulsive.
Some fellows take them in their hands and allow
them to crawl over their heads and faces.</p>

<p><i>January 8th.</i>&mdash;Since 4 a.m. there has been such
a downpour, difficult to imagine if you have not
seen it. Many men, desiring to wash in fresh water,
took advantage of the rain to go on deck with a
piece of soap and wash themselves.</p>

<p>At this blessed moment I have to go to the
inquiry in the <i>Malay</i>.</p>

<p>While I was standing at a closed hatchway on
deck, waiting for the captain of the <i>Malay</i>, a man
was wandering about in white uniform, barefooted
and capless. I paid no attention to him. Suddenly
he approached me and stretched out his hand. I
hesitated, thinking he was a drunken sailor playing
a joke. "I knew you very well long ago. I am
Titoff," he said. Then I guessed that this was the
mad ensign from the battleship <i>Orel</i>. I shook hands
with him, and said that I had not recognised him
because he had grown a beard, although in deed it
was only of two or three days' growth. He began
to laugh, asked me if I feared Death, and had I
seen him; and, pointing all round, he said, "This
is all Russia," etc. They were not very pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
minutes that I spent in his company. It was sad
to see him. He walks about the dirty deck half
undressed. He does what he likes. He may fall
overboard, or fall down a hatchway, or slip from
a ladder&mdash;no one looks after him. A melancholy
spectacle!</p>

<p>I returned to the <i>Suvaroff</i> from the <i>Malay</i> at
twelve o'clock. I was hot and tired. Now the
sun's rays are nearly vertical. I wetted my head
with salt water and put a wet handkerchief in my
cap. The leather of my boots burnt my feet. I
found a letter from the captain of the <i>Jemchug</i>
awaiting me. I must go there and to the <i>Donskoi</i>.
I am tired of going to the latter; I have to go there
nearly every day. I lunched in my cabin. The
orderly who waited on me said, "I have brought
you a beetle."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> I did not understand at first what
he meant. Apparently it was a block of wood to
put under the feet when sitting at the writing-table.</p>

<p>6 p.m.&mdash;Have been to the <i>Gortchakoff</i>, <i>Borodino</i>,
<i>Donskoi</i>, and <i>Jemchug</i>. In the latter they are also
using jam-pots as tumblers. It is a wearisome
cruise. Officers and men have so many inconveniences
and discomforts to bear.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
<p>A fine company are collected in the <i>Malay</i> to
go back to Russia&mdash;the sick, prisoners, men dismissed
from the service, lunatics, and drunkards.
The captain has already reported that they do not
obey him&mdash;abuse and threaten to kill him. Their
conduct is defiant, and they will not submit to any
orders. If they do not send a trusty guard he will
always have to carry a loaded revolver, and shoot
the first one who disobeys. In this steamer a strong
and firm captain is required in order to reach a
Russian port in safety with such a crew.</p>

<p>A court for trying offences during the voyage was
appointed to the fleet. To-day this court assembled
to try a sailor of the <i>Suvaroff</i>. He had abused
the chief boatswain, threatened, and disobeyed the
orders of the first lieutenant. He was sentenced to
three and a half years in a disciplinary battalion.
Probably he will be sent to Russia in the <i>Malay</i>.</p>

<p><i>January 9th.</i>&mdash;The foreboding about the <i>Malay</i>
is beginning to be justified. Last night an armed
crew had to be sent to arrest the mutineers. They
arrested four of the <i>Malay's</i> hired crew. These
have been divided among the battleships, in order
that they may be put in cells. The most insolent
is on board the <i>Suvaroff</i>. The appearance of the
armed crew in the <i>Malay</i> produced a great sensation.
The rest of her crew instantly quieted down. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
evidently had not expected the matter to end in
this sad way.</p>

<p>After those arrested have done some days in
cells, it has been decided to put them on shore and
abandon them to the dictates of fate. To be in
cells on board the <i>Borodino</i> is tolerable, but in
the <i>Suvaroff</i>, "God forbid!" The temperature
there is fearful, and there is no ventilation. I
do not think that a man could remain there long.
Among the four prisoners one only is the ringleader.
It is he who is in the <i>Suvaroff</i>. One of them actually
cried. To be cast upon a nearly desert shore!
What will they do? There is no employment for
them, and they lack the means of getting away.
Could they join the foreign legion? It is not here,
now that this place is unimportant.</p>

<p>I have not told you what the foreign legion is. The
French Government only enlists foreigners in it. It
is stationed in wild places in the colonies where the
population is unsettled. Desperate men, criminals,
escaped convicts, and adventurers serve in it. On
entering it they do not ask for passports, nor do
they inquire into antecedents. In it are to be met
representatives of every nation and of every grade
of society. Its ranks consist of common soldiers,
aristocrats, officers, and hawkers. Discipline in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the legion is very strict in order to keep this rabble
in submission. There are said to be many Russians
in it. The legion was stationed in Madagascar for
a long time, but the French transferred it to some
other place. Now they regret this, and have brought
the legion back, because it required so large a force
of ordinary troops to cope with the natives. The
foreign legion alone could deal with them. I suppose
it dealt harshly and savagely with the natives,
killing, robbing them, and burning their villages
for every offence, real or imaginary. Owing to
this the settlements were peaceful, and dared not
rise against the French.</p>

<p><i>January 10th.</i>&mdash;In the wardroom of the <i>Suvaroff</i>
there is a piano on which they play with the help
of a pianola. There are very few who play the
piano. To-day a sub-lieutenant came on board
from another ship. He proved to be a splendid
musician. For a long time they listened to his
playing. Then they started capering and playing
tricks. It was curious to see officers dancing the
cake walk and the Kamarinsky (a Russian national
dance), etc. They dressed up for these dances.
They did this from sheer boredom. This wearisome
and monotonous cruise has lasted so long.
On the 16th the fleet will have been kicking their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
heels here for a month. No wonder they are silly
from stagnation. Here is another of their amusements&mdash;they
bait the dogs, and every one eagerly
watches, applauding the fighting curs.</p>

<p>There are many suspicious characters in Madagascar.
One appeared at Nosi Be, speaking Russian.
He offered his services as contractor to supply
provisions for the <i>Suvaroff</i> and other ships. This
person roamed about in Tamatave, and now without
any apparent cause has come here. He is very
badly dressed and has long hair like a Slav woman.</p>

<p>The mail-steamer left to-night for Europe. From
Mayung cipher telegrams have been received.
Perhaps they again tell us nothing useful. The
situation of the fleet is most unsettled. Will it
return to Russia, will it remain somewhere here, or
will it go to the East? No one knows. This uncertainty
oppresses me as well as others.</p>

<p>Bad meat is daily thrown overboard in the
<i>Esperanza</i>. Food for the sharks is abundant. They
have collected in great numbers at Nosi Be. Nearly
all the ships keep oxen on deck. There is even a
cow and a calf on board the <i>Suvaroff</i>. They have
built them a manger. The crew look after them
with special fondness, feeding them with bread
and giving them names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a curious sight, watching these animals being
brought on board. They come tied up in boats, and
are generally hoisted into the ship by means of a
strop (loop of rope) tied under their bodies. For
some reason, on board the <i>Suvaroff</i> they are dragged
up by the horns. The frightened animals, with
wild and glaring eyes, struggle violently, hanging in
mid-air. They lie down on deck at first, half crazy,
and then suddenly jump on their feet and toss
themselves about. They are then held and pacified.</p>

<p>It was quite different with the cow. She
tore herself loose and galloped frantically about
the deck. All the spectators fled wherever they
could. She charged at the deck-house, where an
officer was sitting writing. He had hardly time to
shut and lock the door. Somehow or other they
caught the cow, but her milk supply has ceased,
owing to fright, and the calf is still young. They
now feed him on condensed milk. We wonder if
the milk will come back to the cow. We are all
interested in the matter, and discuss it freely. Life
on board is so dreary, dull, and monotonous, that
the most paltry trifles, which we would never dream
of talking about on shore, become a ceaseless topic
of conversation. If we only could get quickly
out of this mire!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p><i>January 11th.</i>&mdash;Heat, stuffiness, damp, dirt&mdash;everywhere
beastliness, deadly gloom, uncertainty
of the near future, lack of news from the seat of
war, oppress and overwhelm us; but can incompetence
reigning everywhere, laziness, stupidity,
ignorance, unwillingness to work, listlessness, make
us cheerful? What goes on here is perfectly
incredible.</p>

<p>There is news that the Hamburg-American
liner <i>Bengal</i> sank near the southern coast of
Madagascar, having ripped her bottom on a
sunken rock. She was a large 18,000-ton steamer,
and was bringing coal for the fleet. Her crew were
saved.</p>

<p>A deplorably sad and stupid incident occurred
in the <i>Nachimoff</i> yesterday. Ships having no
bakery on board obtain their bread, when at
anchorage, from other ships or from the shore.
They did not trouble about the matter in the
<i>Nachimoff</i>. The crew were living on rusks. Yesterday
they demanded fresh bread. The affair spread,
and the men offered passive resistance by not dismissing
after prayers, though ordered to do so.
There is now to be an inquiry. At other times
and under other conditions some of the crew would
have been distributed among the other ships, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
some would have been shot&mdash;there would have
been no other alternative. Now they are trying to
hush the matter up. In spite of this, some will
suffer.</p>

<p>One of the <i>Malay</i> prisoners who was in cells in
the <i>Alexander</i> has been sent to the hospital-ship
<i>Orel</i>, as he fell ill from the hot temperature in his
prison.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

WAITING FOR ORDERS</h2>


<p><i>January 12th.</i>&mdash;It is very possible that on the
16th the fleet will receive instructions from
Petersburg either to return, proceed to the East, or
stay somewhere here until further orders. I wish
they would decide quickly. Uncertainty is worse than
anything. It is very unhealthy, staying here during
the rainy season. Fevers, dysentery, and similar
delights are rampant. Europeans cannot stand the
climate. Anchorages like our present one end by
having a bad effect on the spirits of the crew. They
deteriorate. The affair in the <i>Nachimoff</i> serves as
an example of this.</p>

<p>There has been a signal that we are to have
steam up at 6.30 to-morrow morning, in order
to go out to sea for firing. This will be our first
practice since leaving Revel.</p>

<p>I have not been ashore to-day. I was lazy,
though the weather was tolerable. The rain is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
not incessant. They have brought a puppy on
board, some shellfish, and some hermit crabs.
They torment the molluscs by pouring eau de
Cologne over them, puffing tobacco-smoke at them,
and by burning them with matches. A lively
occupation, but really it is excusable; there are
no distractions, and they have invented this.</p>

<p><i>January 13th.</i>&mdash;Weather is pleasant in harbour;
probably it will be calm at sea as well. We are
going to fire. We weighed anchor at 8 a.m. French
torpedo-boats have followed us. They brought
telegrams from Mayung. They went into harbour
at Nosi Be, and handed over telegrams to the
torpedo-boat <i>Bodry</i>. The latter pursued the <i>Suvaroff</i>,
and passed the telegrams to the admiral
by means of a rope-end. What news do they
contain?</p>

<p>Firing is just beginning. Everything is tightly
closed. The mirrors have been taken down and
crockery put away.</p>

<p>6 p.m.&mdash;The ships have finished their firing, and
we are now going into the anchorage.</p>

<p>Reuter's telegrams state that Petersburg and
Moscow are under martial law and surrounded by
a chain of troops; that the mutiny of sailors at
Sevastopol continues; that they have burnt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
barracks and Admiralty there; that the troops
have refused to fire on the mutineers; and that
military disorders are rife throughout Russia.
These telegrams must be read with reserve, but I,
at any rate, believe them. During man&oelig;uvres
to-day the <i>Borodino</i> and <i>Alexander</i> nearly collided.
Thank God, this accident was averted. It would
have been appalling.</p>

<p>A few days ago they were doing some work
in the <i>Suvaroff</i> and opened a valve. They forgot
to shut it, and opened another one yesterday, not
knowing that the first had not been closed. In
the night a whole compartment was flooded, and
water poured into the engine-room. How I cursed
that I had come in the fleet! Here you sit chained,
seeing the mistakes of others, and are powerless to
do anything. At times I really fear that I shall
go mad.</p>

<p><i>January 14th.</i>&mdash;The colliers brought news that
the <i>Oleg</i> has captured a steamer which was taking
two hundred and sixty field-guns to Japan. It
sounds improbable. This steamer, as far as I know,
should have gone round Africa; and there our
auxiliary cruisers awaited her.</p>

<p>I went to a café on shore and played cards. I
lost 170 francs (about 64 roubles). Returned on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
board about seven o'clock, late for dinner, so dined
in my cabin. On shore I saw the man who was
suspected of being a spy. He is very like a Russian,
and wears his long red hair like an artist.</p>

<p>11 p.m.&mdash;Wonderfully practical folk, the Germans!
They have sent officers to the colliers to
help the captains. These officers are sent in order
that they may watch our cruise and give useful
information to their own navy. Would Russia do
anything similar? No, never! This is why we
are paying so dearly now. We are still far from
having a fine navy or army. It is not a question
of soldiers, but of organising a campaign, of constant
preparation and of foresight.</p>

<p>What a variety of coinage there was on the card-table&mdash;French,
English, Russian, Italian, and Austrian.
They play for very high stakes. One
lieutenant in an hour won and lost 5,000 francs.</p>

<p>We are daily expecting the arrival of the <i>Oleg</i>,
<i>Isumrud</i>, and torpedo-boats. Judging by time,
they are near Nosi Be. This is according to telegraphic
agencies. Official news we never receive.
It is always like that with us in Russia.</p>

<p>The mail-steamer from Europe arrives on the
20th and returns on the 24th. We shall evidently
wait here for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>The supposition that we should remain a long
time in Madagascar is amply justified. It is exactly
a month to-morrow since the fleet arrived at this
island. That is how time flies. We have lost a
whole month uselessly, and it is still unknown how
much longer we shall be here.</p>

<p>What are they thinking of in Petersburg? There
are rumours here that after Klado's articles the
public will demand the return of the fleet to Russia.
Can it be that, even now, they are unable to decide
whether to go backward or forward? The upkeep
of the fleet costs large sums. It cannot become
better or stronger, remaining whole weeks at anchor
in Nosi Be. On the contrary, it will do nothing
but harm. By wasting time here we give the
Japanese the chance of repairing their ships and
boilers. They are secretly preparing to meet us
now. We have no bases. Can we be trusting to
our country or merely to luck? What were they
thinking about in sending the fleet? Our fleet is
Russia's last might. If it is destroyed, we shall
have no navy. Every one thinks this&mdash;I am not the
only one. All this can scarcely raise the spirits of the
men. Probably something similar is going on in the
army. It is bad! Everything is bad, and there are
internal disorders as well. How will it all end?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p><i>January 15th.</i>&mdash;I have again been on shore. I
learnt that the steamer <i>Vladimir</i> of the volunteer
fleet is leaking. I will go and look at her to-morrow.
A new signboard has appeared on shore&mdash;"Skopolites,
contractor of the fleet," in freshly painted
characters.</p>

<p>Shortly before leaving the ship a sailor fell into
the water and made for a native boat. The negro
hawkers took five francs from him, and wanted
to row away without him. The sailor was rescued
and the negroes were deprived of his money. The
officers buy all sorts of useless rubbish, which, after
they have taken it on board, is thrown aside and
forgotten. I posted a letter to-day, went to the
café, and played macao, winning 250 francs. I
went round the shops, but, finding nothing of interest,
returned to the café. I did not play, and
afterwards set out for the quay.</p>

<p>The <i>Esperanza</i> has just come from sea. She
leaves the harbour daily to throw bad meat overboard.
She informs us that she saw three large
warships and one small one far away. Perhaps
they are Japanese. I myself saw a Japanese on
shore to-day. Many others saw him. At one
time there were not any to be seen.</p>

<p>Cipher telegrams have again been received.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
They have not yet been deciphered. It is astonishing
that they should inform us in cipher who has
received rewards. The telegraphic agencies relate
horrors about Russia's internal affairs. Among
other things they mention serious disorders in
Petersburg. They say that it has come to barricades
in the street&mdash;that more than 2,000 men are
killed, and more than 7,000 wounded. I fancy
they lie, but there is never smoke without fire.</p>

<p>I have to go to the hospital-ship <i>Orel</i> to-morrow.
The boats have to be fitted for the transport of
the wounded. What were they thinking of before?
This steamer was fitted out as a hospital and cost
a great deal of money, but the boats were forgotten.
Everywhere we make some stupid mistake.</p>

<p>My beard has grown tremendously, and is very
shaggy. I have not trimmed it. Every one hinted
that it was time to have it cut, and at last the
admiral and flag-captain spoke about it. I summoned
the sailor Michael, who cut it so short
that, looking in the glass, I did not recognise
myself.</p>

<p><i>January 16th.</i>&mdash;The <i>Esperanza's</i> news has produced
active measures. Until the moon rises all
fighting-lamps are to be lit. They had seen that
the Japanese, whom I mentioned yesterday, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
sending telegrams by heliograph. He attempted
to come on board our ships with the contractors.</p>

<p>The German colliers brought news that newly
bought ships are coming to reinforce us, and are at
present at Cape Verde. Probably this is another
canard. We shall soon see if it is true. It is a
month's voyage for them to Nosi Be. This reinforcement
would be most welcome. I do not believe
in it. These same Germans assure us that the
Black Sea fleet has left. They spoke about this
long ago, and there is no sign of it. They evidently
mistook the <i>Oleg</i> and her companions for the Black
Sea fleet.</p>

<p>I have been on board the <i>Keiff</i> and <i>Vladimir</i> of
the volunteer fleet to-day. Life in them is heavenly
compared with life on board ships of the <i>Borodino</i>
type. There is plenty of space and the cabins are
large, clean, and quiet. They live well, have free
communication with the shore, etc. I remained
to lunch in the <i>Vladimir</i>, and returned to my ship
in her steamboat.</p>

<p>Some sailor in the transport <i>Jupiter</i> out of revenge
cast off the collier's boat from the steamer and it
drifted ashore with the current. Although it was
night and the boat was floating away from the
transport, they managed to catch it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a church on shore. Many Roman
Catholics took the opportunity of making their
confession. The confession was an empty one&mdash;that
is, they did not confess to a priest, as the
greater part of them had not command enough
of the French language to speak of their sins.</p>

<p>My servant brought me a letter to be sent to his
wife. "My wife," he said, "is also called Sophie."
He is a curious fellow, but I am satisfied with
him.</p>

<p>I heard various details of the Petersburg disorders
in the <i>Vladimir</i>.</p>

<p>The Europeans here live in a most extraordinary
way. They come to the colony to make money,
and then quickly return to their own countries.
They deprive themselves of everything. They live
almost in huts, and do not spend a sou more than
they can help. After a few years of such life they
become fairly well off, and leave the colony for
ever. Their abodes are like a camp. The furniture
is bad and broken. There are no conveniences,
and no thought of comfort.</p>

<p>There is no news. Telegrams are sent by heliograph
to Diego Suarez.</p>

<p><i>January 17th.</i>&mdash;A telegram has been received
saying the <i>Rezvy</i> has left her division, and remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
at Jibutil owing to breakdown. She will probably
not go to the East at all.</p>

<p>Yesterday the local governor came to the admiral
with a complaint that the officers of the fleet play
games of hazard for high stakes at the café. Play
is forbidden or all leave will be stopped. Two
or three days ago the German colliers celebrated
Wilhelm's birthday. They dressed their ship with
flags and drank so much that they remained drunk
until to-day.</p>

<p>As the fleet moves forward the number of torpedo-boats
grows less and less. Those that remain
with us have damaged boilers, thanks to which
they are unable to attain their full speed.</p>

<p>The captain of the port at Diego Suarez went
round our ships. He was saluted. Evidently this
amused him.</p>

<p>To-morrow part of the fleet are going to sea for
target-practice.</p>

<p>When shall we leave here? We are losing the
best weather. Hurricanes, cyclones, and storms
will begin soon, and with a fleet like ours the voyage
will be very difficult. Before us lies an immense
passage&mdash;viz. from Madagascar to the islands of the
East Indian Archipelago.</p>

<p><i>January 18th.</i>&mdash;Owing to high play we are forbidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to go ashore on weekdays. An order has
been given to verify the cash of all the paymasters
in the fleet.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Nosi Be consider the fleet the
cause of there being so little rain. It generally
comes down in bucketfuls every day during the
rainy season. Now the rain is coming at intervals
and it is bad for the crops. The natives are making
offerings and have started a religious procession.
Perhaps they are right, and the fleet is the cause of so
little rain.  It is necessary for the downpour of
tropical rain that much electricity should collect
in the air. It may be that the masts of our ships
conduct the current of electricity into the water,
not allowing it to collect in sufficient quantities in
the air for rain. Doubtless the natives explain
it differently.</p>

<p>More and more frequently, at times, there falls
on me complete oblivion to my surroundings. I
have become absolutely apathetic. Everything is
quite indistinct. Nothing interests me. My mind
is crushed. I have such attacks of endless despair,
such fancies, such horrible thoughts, that, by God,
I do not know what to do, where to hide, or how
to forget myself.</p>

<p>8 p.m.&mdash;We have returned and anchored at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Nosi Be.  To-morrow the fleet must go to sea
again for firing.</p>

<p>Since this morning they have been painting my
cabin. How am I to sleep? It smells strongly
of paint and turpentine. It will most probably
give me a headache.</p>

<p>The French torpedo-boats have brought neither
telegrams nor news to-day. I got up early this
morning and had no rest during the day, am fearfully
tired, and shall have to get up earlier than ever.</p>

<p><i>January 19th.</i>&mdash;Since communication with the
shore is forbidden, I have to take every opportunity
of sending my letters. I think it will be difficult
for you to read my epistles. They are full of
broken, unconnected sentences and muddled incidents.
It will most likely be difficult for me to
make them out myself. You receive several at a
time, and that makes it more confused.</p>

<p>Up till 8 a.m. we were getting up anchor, and then
we went out to sea. Yesterday a projectile ricochetted
on to the <i>Donskoi</i>. It touched the bridge,
slightly damaged it, and flew further. No one was
killed or wounded, thank God! It might have
had a much worse ending.</p>

<p>At five o'clock we returned to Nosi Be, not
having hit anything this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>The admiral received a letter from the individual
whom they suspected of being a spy, in which he
complains of the unjust accusation. He says that
an officer tried to poison him when he went on
board the <i>Ural</i>, and that the Governor has offered
to send him away from Nosi Be. Finally, he begs
for money for his passage. The contractor with
whom he came on board explained to the Governor
about him. Among other things the contractor
says that the man is continually disappearing, that
they had to look for him in the ship, and that
once he ate from the common tub with the crew.
Knowing Russian, he was able to hide from the
officers.</p>

<p>Is it not extraordinary? A spy is going about
our ships quite unpunished. It is a marvel! As if
anything similar could happen to the Japanese!
I do not think so! It is all so disgusting that I
do not like to speak of it. You know what sort
of characters there are in the fleet. When we were
in Russia a man came and begged to be allowed
to join the fleet. He threatened that if they did
not take him he would shoot himself, and appointed
a time. They accepted him, promoted him to the
rank of petty officer, and then discovered that
he was under age. However, it was too late; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
is now cruising. There are several indications
that the fleet will not leave here soon.</p>

<p>They have brought news from the shore that
Kuropatkin is about to take the initiative. We
have already heard this so many times that we do
not believe it.</p>

<p><i>January 20th.</i>&mdash;To-day the French mail-boat
ought to arrive. Many expect letters. Communication
with the shore is allowed. I do not want to go,
and have asked some officers to buy me three mats,
three caps, and some postage stamps. I do not
understand how they can go ashore just as the mail
will be brought on board and be sorted. Do they
really not care for the letters or for their contents?
No; evidently "we are not all made of the same
dough." Force would not take me out of the ship
just now. It may be that the post we expected
to receive from the <i>Oleg</i> has just been brought by
the French mail-steamer.</p>

<p>What a disappointment! Only boots and tobacco,
which were ordered and not sent to Admiral Folkersham
through lack of time.</p>

<p>They brought the mail to the <i>Suvaroff</i> and began
sorting it. I took an active part, cutting the bags,
sorting the letters, and calling out the names of the
ships. A great many officers helped. Writers came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
from all the ships, and surrounded the deck-house
where the letters were being sorted. Sometimes a
letter for me fell into my hands. I put it into my
pocket. Sometimes my name was called out and
a letter given me.</p>

<p>The sorting ended, I flew to my cabin, and there
on the table was another letter and a large
official parcel. The latter was a book on ship-construction
sent by the Committee. The rest of
the letters were from you. I read them, and did
not know what to do. I was agitated. I went
and sat in an armchair in the admiral's after-cabin,
and gazed and gazed through the balcony door at
the harbour.</p>

<p>An orderly came and said that a cadet from
the <i>Borodino</i> was asking for me. I was surprised.
I went out, and he gave me another
packet of letters bound with a ribbon, and said his
captain found them among his letters. I thanked
the cadet, and begged him to express my thanks to
the captain. To whom were not letters addressed?
To those ships lying quietly at Libau and Cronstadt,
and to the ships that had been destroyed at Port
Arthur. There was a letter for Popoff, who was
killed in the <i>Ural</i>, and one for Titoff, who went
mad and is in the <i>Malay</i>. Every one, having read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
their letters, seized the papers and devoured them
greedily, grew heated, and quarrelled.</p>

<p>Dinner to-day was specially lively. Several of
the staff received rewards. Everybody had
letters and parcels, and, what was extraordinary,
most of the parcels contained warm clothing.
There were many toasts drunk, and the band
played. Two fellows were moved to tears. They
had not had news from home for a long time, and
now they received it all at once. If a torpedo-boat
brings me your telegram, I shall be quite happy.</p>

<p><i>January 21st.</i>&mdash;A Japanese spy came on board
the <i>Suvaroff</i> yesterday in the guise of a trader.
No attempt, even, was made to detain him. The
officials at the post-office are surprised that the
Russians send all their letters registered.</p>

<p>From the post-office I went round the shops with
an officer. I bought some lovely postcards. We
wandered into the village. A dog that was with
us had a slight sunstroke. We took it into a café,
rubbed its head with ice, bathed it, and now it has
recovered.</p>

<p>There is news that order has been established
in Petersburg. Thank God! The French say that
the <i>Oleg</i> only left Jibutil on the 20th. That means
she will not be here for a week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>They have just read aloud in the wardroom the
answer from Admiral Birilieff. As you can imagine,
the majority are furious with him. They say,
"How dare he abuse the fleet? Who gave him the
right to do so? He knows nothing about it, though
he is serving in the navy." These naval men dare
to talk, after having ignominiously and needlessly
ruined a navy twice as strong as the Japanese,
scarcely doing any harm to the latter.</p>

<p>What can be more infamous than the conduct of
our navy? There has been nothing like it since the
creation of the world. Words fail me to describe
the shameless dishonour. They have the impertinence
to say, "Who dare criticise us?" Imagine what I
heard to-day. They said, "What the devil does it
mean? It is perfectly revolting! Rewards are
showered on the land forces, and we sailors have had
nothing for Port Arthur." I am telling you the
truth, word for word. When I heard it I was
thunderstruck.</p>

<p>When will there be an end to this inefficiency,
bragging, and conceit? Russia may not ask these
officers, "Where is the navy that was built by the
sweat of millions of Russian people? What has it
done? Has it done harm to the enemy? Will it
help the fatherland? Will it add to the glory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Russia?" Oh no! you must not ask sailors these
questions. They are more expert engineers than
engineers themselves. They have more legal knowledge
than lawyers. The naval ministry was created
for themselves. They are demi-gods. They only are
entitled to honours, riches, glory, everything; but
naval work they do not understand. They do not
serve for war, and are not prepared for it. The
navy is to them the means of getting all the good
things of life. They may be judges of others, hold
their heads high and say, "We are naval officers.
What more do you want?"</p>

<p>However bitter this may sound, it is true.
Do you remember my telling you how it would be?
This voyage confirms my old opinions. To think
that Russia counts on them! I never cared for
Birilieff as a man, but we must thank him and
Klado for their articles. Let Russia make acquaintance
with the archaic systems of, and what she
can expect from, our glorious Russian navy.</p>

<p>I was getting ready for church just as they brought
me your telegram. I was tremendously pleased,
and no wonder, as I was waiting nine days for my
answer.</p>

<p>They are sending the band to play on the shore.
The officers played tennis with the governor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
his wife. A sad thing happened on shore: a
sailor hit a petty officer in the face.</p>

<p><i>January 24th.</i>&mdash;Thanks to the affair yesterday,
leave to go ashore is only granted for the half-day.
If it is absolutely necessary to send a boat later,
then they have to ask the admiral's permission.</p>

<p>It appears that there were several disturbances
on shore yesterday, and all caused by a petty
officer.</p>

<p>To-morrow we are going to sea for target-practice.
To-day the torpedo-boat <i>Blestyastchy</i> (Brilliant)
lowered a boat, which capsized. Three men were
drowned. There are fatalities in the fleet nearly
every day.</p>

<p><i>January 25th.</i>&mdash;I read the newspaper cuttings you
sent me. While the ships went out for target-practice,
the mining cutters were left behind for
exercise. They went a little way out to sea, and
saved six natives whose catamaran upset.</p>

<p>One officer had sunstroke, but recovered. It is
very dangerous to go about here with an uncovered
head, or to take off one's cap frequently, even if the
sun is behind clouds. The Europeans do not risk
going out of doors without a helmet. They continually
warn Russians, but we are like the man
who does not cross himself when it is not thundering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Perhaps we shall go to sea to-morrow for evolutions
and firing. On Sunday it is proposed to have a race
for the boats of all ships in the fleet. Many are
grumbling&mdash;they will not be able to go ashore owing
to these races.</p>

<p>What a lot of time the fleet has wasted lying
here! We might have been at Vladivostok by now.
The <i>Oleg</i> is detained somewhere. She will arrive
at the end of the month. I think with horror that,
even with her arrival, in Petersburg they have not
yet decided our fate, but compel us to wait for the
third fleet. And when will it reach here! Not for
a long time&mdash;not for a very long time.</p>

<p><i>January 26th.</i>&mdash;When I was in the wardroom on
board the <i>Aurora</i> a cannon-shot suddenly thundered
overhead. It was the <i>Kamchatka</i> saluting the
corpse of the sailor who died in the hospital-ship
<i>Orel</i>. Passing the <i>Kamchatka</i>, with white foam at
her bows, was a long, narrow, black torpedo-boat.
A row of men dressed all in white stood on her deck.
The sound of the funeral hymn was heard. In the
stern stood the priest with incense, near the coffin,
which was sewn up with yellow canvas and covered
with St. Andrew's flag.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>  The torpedo-boat was
carrying out to sea for burial another Russian, who
had died far from home. Many have perished in
the fleet. Not long ago three men were drowned.
Another one has died to-day. I am told that
during the evolutions of the fleet the <i>Suvaroff</i> nearly
rammed the <i>Kuban</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>
<p><i>January 26th.</i>&mdash;It is exactly a year to-day since
the war with Japan began. A sad anniversary!
Up to now this war has brought us nothing but
shame, misfortune, and ruin.</p>

<p>The <i>Svietlana</i> was told to bring the Russian mail
from Mojanga. We received it at six o'clock.
There is again a mix-up of addresses. Letters were
addressed to the Electrotechnical Institute of the
Emperor Alexander III.</p>

<p><i>January 29th.</i>&mdash;A curious comedy has been
enacted on shore by the Governor's wife and the
wife of a merchant. The Governor's wife came
to the other lady and accused her of spreading
scandal, saying that the Governor had complained
to Admiral Rojdestvensky that the Russian officers
were getting drunk on shore. "My husband,"
said the Governor's wife, "did not go to the admiral;
but your husband went to complain that the officers
were behaving badly. I know why he did it. The
officers did not get drunk, but they paid you attentions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and you encouraged them. It is owing to
you that the officers are not allowed on shore," etc.</p>

<p>The ladies were thoroughly frightened. The merchant
has now written to the flag-captain, stating
this story and asking for "satisfaction," as he
never complained, and, on the contrary, could not
praise enough the behaviour of the officers. (I told
you why their leave was stopped&mdash;it was owing to
their gambling at cards.) It would be interesting to
know how the flag-captain answered the merchant,
and what the latter will do with the "satisfaction"
if he gets it. Again it is a case of women.</p>

<p>I wanted to seal a parcel, and remembered that
they do not accept them with seals at the post-office,
as sealing-wax melts from the heat.</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand how the traders make
a living here. They have opened several shops
and raised the prices tremendously. They intrigue
against each other and complain to the admiral.
The <i>Esperanza</i> bought up all the provisions at
Mojanga, and has now gone for materials. What a
quantity of money the ships have spent here! Truly
Russia has enriched Nosi Be, Mojanga, and Diego
Suarez. They have even ordered goods from
France.</p>

<p><i>January 30th.</i>&mdash;It is very hot to-day. It is long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
since there were heavy rains. Light rain does not
cool the sides of the ship, which remain hot the
whole twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Lunch to-day was interrupted by the funeral of
a sailor of the <i>Borodino</i>. The torpedo-boat passed
the <i>Suvaroff</i> with his body. The man died in a very
strange way. He was in the hospital-ship <i>Orel</i>.
He was discharged from the sick-list, and was sitting
waiting for the boat to take him back to the <i>Borodino</i>
when he fell down dead. Behind the torpedo-boat
came a steamboat with the captain. He was accompanying
his sailor to burial.</p>

<p>The majority of officers have leave to go ashore
to-day until 6 p.m. The watches of a good number
are damaged, broken, or choked with dust. They
have bought up all the watches in the place, and
many of these are broken and cannot be mended.
They have cleared everything out of Mojanga. At
the bank they cannot even change a credit note
for a few thousand francs.</p>

<p>A good many people earn a living as money-changers.
For a pound they sometimes give 24
francs 50 centimes, and sometimes 25 francs 40
centimes. Thus on a pound, which is less than ten
roubles, you lose about 34 copecks (8<i>d.</i>). The fleet
is paid in pounds, and loses considerably. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
German company here buys up all the pounds and
gains large profits. The officers want to ask them
to change the credit notes.</p>

<p>This is how the Germans do business. They
buy land and let it to ruined Frenchmen, compelling
them to sell vanilla at a low price. They
buy up leather, cocoa-nut oil, coffee, etc., and
send it green to Europe, where it is sold at immense
profit.</p>

<p>They say that when the band played on shore
to-day the local queen was present. She is of no
importance, and has been left alone by the French,
who are the real owners of the country. This
queen behaves with dignity, and does not ask for
money.</p>

<p>A sailor in the <i>Oslyabya</i> stole a box of church
offerings. He was found out and arrested, and
will probably be tried by special court.</p>

<p><i>January 31st.</i>&mdash;I went ashore at 10 a.m. I went
to a vanilla plantation, called at the church and
at the school, which is kept by the Carmelite order.
I am sitting in a restaurant with an officer. We
are drinking lemonade with grenadines and ice in
it. By twelve I shall be on board the <i>Suvaroff</i>, and
at one attend a court of inquiry. At the plantation
we had an argument with some Frenchmen because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
we had broken a branch of vanilla. The heat was
so great that I drank plain water, which I never
do on shore. It is extraordinary how spoilt the
natives are. They followed us all the time, although
we drove them off, and then demanded a tip.</p>

<p><i>February 4th.</i>&mdash;There has been a dreadful storm.
The lightning was blinding and the thunder absolutely
deafening. Russian sign-boards are hung
all over Nosi Be. Among them is the following:
"Tremendous bargains! Come and buy."</p>

<p>There is a dearth of stamps in the post-office.
For a long time there have been no 25-centime
stamps, and very few of any other kind.</p>

<p><i>February 5th.</i>&mdash;The admiral has been unwell
lately. He had neuralgia so badly yesterday that
he even moaned. He did not sleep last night, and
is now lying down. He does not listen to the doctor's
advice. He did not come to morning tea or lunch.</p>

<p>I had my hair cut and my beard trimmed. Do you
know how this operation is performed? The
flagship's barber Michael appears in dirty working
clothes, with a box in which are a machine, an old
brush, and a razor. You sit on a chair and cover
yourself with a towel. Michael cuts. It is hot,
and the perspiration drops from his face. Having
finished, he puts up his implements, receives a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
copper, shakes out the towel, hangs it up, gathers
up from the deck the fallen hairs, presses them
into his fist, and departs. All this is done so simply.</p>

<p>The admiral did not leave his cabin even for meals
to-day. The doctors now say that he has rheumatism.
Last night he cried out with pain. They
wanted some ice for him. There was none in the
<i>Suvaroff</i>, so an officer went to the other ships to
find some. The confusion was great.</p>

<p><i>February 6th.</i>&mdash;As the admiral is ill I did not get
up for breakfast. Woke just before nine and went to
sleep again until five o'clock. It was not very hot
and stuffy. Usually it is impossible to sleep by
day in a cabin.</p>

<p>There was mass to-day.</p>

<p>A Frenchman who has opened a shop on shore
came to tell us about a Japanese spy. We do not
believe him, and think he is making a report to
advertise his wares. As a rule Frenchmen are
great humbugs. The admiral recovered and came
to dinner. Some of the officials at the post-office
have learnt Russian words. They show off their
knowledge by writing "Petersburg" on the receipts
in Russian.</p>

<p>We still remain here, and Nosi Be is getting
quite Russianised. From the telegrams which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the French torpedo-boat brought from Mojanga
we learn that the Governor-General of Moscow
has been killed, and that the third fleet left Libau
on February 2nd.</p>

<p>It will be a surprise if we are obliged to wait
for the famous third fleet. It is very injurious
for our ships, being kept in Nosi Be. Their underwater
parts will be covered with barnacles and
waterweeds (commonly known as beard). Owing
to this ships steam considerably slower and require
a greater expenditure of coal, etc. The
barnacles and beard have to be cleaned off in dock,
and there are none available in this part of the
world. Cleaning the underwater parts with the
help of divers is slow and unsatisfactory. How
important it is may be seen from the fact that even
merchant ships voyaging in southern and eastern
waters go into dock to be cleaned at least once in
six months. We shall arrive in the East with dirty
ships, and the Japanese will meet us in clean ones.
Our ships will have just made a long voyage, and
theirs will come out of harbour.</p>

<p>Another fine thing is that the Japanese will raise
our ships sunk at Port Arthur, repair them, and
oppose them to us under their old names. They
will strengthen their fleet in this way, and what a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
disgrace it will be for Russia. Imagine the scene!
Some <i>Poltava</i> or <i>Retvizan</i> will fire on the <i>Suvaroff</i>.
It is too disgusting to think of! And who is it
who has annihilated the fleet? The Japs&mdash;"Apes,"
as our gallant sailors call them! Such self-confidence,
conceit, and contempt for the monkey Japs will cost
Russia dearly. Here I go again, harping on the old
tune. I had better stop, as it does not help.</p>

<p><i>February 7th.</i>&mdash;I lunched in the battleship <i>Orel</i>.
Had soup with rice&mdash;and caterpillars. A satisfying
meal, was it not? The officers of the <i>Orel</i> are convinced
that for several evenings running they have
seen a balloon on the horizon signalling with lights.
One of the officers thought of ordering himself a
pair of white trousers made out of a sheet, as material
is not to be had. There is a consoling description
of the <i>Cesarevitch's</i> damages. Fifteen twelve-inch
shells struck her (this is a tremendous number, and
twelve-inch shells are the heaviest), and not one
pierced her armour. Our battleships <i>Suvaroff</i>,
<i>Borodino</i>, <i>Alexander</i>, and <i>Orel</i> are better armoured
than the <i>Cesarevitch</i>. If twelve-inch shells could
not pierce her armour, smaller projectiles can do
almost nothing&mdash;that is, if they hit protected parts.
Some of the eye-witnesses in the <i>Rossia</i> and <i>Gromoboi</i>
say that the first impressions of the battle were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
horrible. Everything was upside-down and broken
to bits. You looked round and saw that nothing
that was behind armour was touched, and no
substantial damage done to the ship. All this is
very nice, but an endless stay at Nosi Be deprives
one of all energy.</p>

<p><i>February 8th.</i>&mdash;I have been to the <i>Anadir</i>, <i>Kamchatka</i>,
and to the shore. I went to the cemetery.
The caretaker showed me the grave of a Japanese.
I told him to put Popoff's grave in order, as it had
fallen in.</p>

<p><i>February 9th.</i>&mdash;A "tragic occurrence" took place
in the <i>Suvaroff</i> to-day. Some one had eaten a
monkey. There remained only a bit of tail and a
piece of skin. This is the work of either rats or
dogs.</p>

<p>I called at a torpedo-boat this morning. The
captain and officer were sitting on deck drinking
tea. Both were barefooted and in vests and white
trousers. I cannot get accustomed to such a sight,
somehow. The captain's left foot astonished me.
It had only one toe. All the rest had been torn off
long ago. The sight of it gave me a queer feeling.</p>

<p>To-day there was a court-martial on an officer.
In defence of another officer he had written a report
in a very insolent manner to the captain. By order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of the admiral the officer was dismissed from the
<i>Ural</i> in January, and now he is placed on the retired
list by the general staff. I do not know how the
trial will end. They say he is a very good fellow.
The offence of which he is accused is very seriously
punished&mdash;either by degradation to the rank of
sailor or confinement in a fortress.</p>

<p><i>February 10th.</i>&mdash;The court sentenced the officer
to be dismissed the service and deprivation of rank.
The sentence will go to the admiral for confirmation.
The punishment imposed by the court is the lightest
possible. It came out that there is much slackness
in the <i>Ural</i>. The matter will hardly end here, as
they say K&mdash;&mdash; is an obstinate man, and will raise
it again in Petersburg.</p>

<p>There has just been a storm in a tea-cup. Smoke
appeared from a cabin. They manned the pumps
and nearly rang the fire alarm. It was discovered
that a white tunic lying in a basket had caught
fire. They pulled out the basket, drew out the
tunic, and the panic subsided.</p>

<p>The meat at dinner to-day was bad. I ate a
good deal before I discovered what was the matter.</p>

<p>I am trying to find a tortoise on shore. If I
find one, I shall keep its shell for combs and hairpins
for you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>From several sources news has been received that
there are Japanese ships near Madagascar. The
Japanese would hardly be so stupid as to split up
their fleet. Things have come to such a pass in our
ships that they are positively certain that the fleet
will return to Russia on March 15th. They told
me this in the <i>Nachimoff</i>, announcing this sensational
news as the latest trustworthy information.
I stayed a long time in the wardroom of the <i>Nachimoff</i>,
talking to an engineer whom I had known at
school.</p>

<p>Four sailors of the torpedo-boat <i>Grosny</i> (Menacing)
broke into a hut and stole the contents. They
were caught. There will be a trial, and they
will be severely punished. Is it worth it? The
damage is assessed by the negroes at sixty francs,
all told. The men will be ruined for a mere trifle.</p>

<p>The heat is dreadful! You "stew in your own
juice," as they say here, and you drink without
ceasing. It is a good thing that the refrigerator in
the <i>Suvaroff</i> is repaired and you can have ice. At
the present moment I have a glass of iced water by
me. It cannot be had by all. When the refrigerator
was not working they obtained ice for the admiral
from other ships. You cannot imagine the delight
of drinking something cold, if you have not experienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
such great heat. They make a good deal
of ice artificially in the fleet, and on shore they trade
in it.</p>

<p>I have heard there are cigarettes in the <i>Tamboff</i>:
I must go and get some.</p>

<p><i>February 12th.</i>&mdash;Under cover of the French newspapers
they are talking about the conclusion of
peace. They begin to say that it must be concluded,
come what may&mdash;even to paying a large indemnity.
Has Russia really come to this? Is the war really
lost? I cannot bear to think so! The disgrace
was already bad enough, but what a shameful ending!
Unhappy times! Everything is going badly,
both at the war and in the interior of Russia. How
will it all end?</p>

<p>They say that in the <i>Tamboff</i> cigarettes are
being sold at fifteen roubles a hundred. It is
very dear, but there is nothing to be done. I
shall be glad if I can get some, even at that price.</p>

<p>Several cases of champagne were brought to the
<i>Suvaroff</i> to-day. Some sailors managed to conceal
one and hid it in the furnace of a boiler. They
were caught. If the matter is officially dealt with,
they will suffer severely.</p>

<p><i>February 14th.</i>&mdash;I sent a telegram to you yesterday.
There are many sailors who have not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
on shore since we left Cronstadt. A large number
were last on shore at Revel. A short time ago a
sailor of the <i>Kamchatka</i> took two lifebelts, jumped
overboard at night, and struck out for the shore.
He was seen by chance while swimming. The
searchlight was turned on to him. "I was tired
of being on board, could endure it no longer, and
wanted to go on shore," he said in his defence. I
quite understood the man's feelings. I am much
astonished at many of the officers. They have
not been on dry land since they left Revel, although
they have had opportunities of leaving the ship.</p>

<p>My spirits are depressed. Nothing is known as
to when our wanderings will end. I am ready to
do almost anything&mdash;even to leaving the fleet,
which perhaps will not go to the East until the war
is over. How I curse myself for having come! Do
you know there are forty-two ships at Nosi Be
under the Russian naval and merchant flags? A
solid figure, but how many are only transports?
How many officers and men, do you suppose? I
fancy considerably more than 12,000.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

EVENTS AT NOSI BE</h2>


<p><i>February 15th.</i>&mdash;I must without fail go on shore
to-day after dinner to post my letters. I do not
trust others.</p>

<p>I saw a wedding of a mulatto and a Malagassy.
A long procession of negroes went to the mayor's
to sign the contract, and then went to the church,
where the priest married them. I looked on at the
ceremony. Both were young and dressed like
Europeans, and had boots on. The bride wore a
veil, white dress, etc. During the marriage service
dogs ran about the church, but this did not disturb
any one. Probably dogs are not considered unclean
animals here.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Black boys served the priest. The
priest himself was a European missionary. The
whole church was full of black worshippers. Of
course, there were many of our officers there as
spectators. After the service the little Malagassy
with his wife on his arm walked round among the
guests collecting money. I gave them a franc.
It seemed strange, seeing a Christian church full of
blacks reverently fulfilling Christian rites.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>
<p>How dreadfully the men drink sometimes! Today
I saw a sailor being carried on a stretcher,
unconscious and shaking with spasms. It was a
repulsive sight. They say the captain of the <i>Oleg</i> is
in poor health. If it is consumption, the result will
be a sad one. If there is only the suspicion of it,
in this climate the end comes quickly. The wardroom
have made another acquisition. They have
obtained a small crocodile from somewhere. The
<i>Suvaroff</i> is positively becoming a floating menagerie.</p>

<p>We shall probably leave for the East at the end
of the month. If that is the case, why is the third
fleet sent? Every one acts as he thinks fit. There
are no plans, forethought, or system.</p>

<p><i>February 16th.</i>&mdash;There is anxiety about the fate
of the <i>Irtish</i>. She was at Port Said on January 9th,
and should have been here long ago. They have
telegraphed asking about her. It is exactly two
months to-day since we came to Madagascar. If
we leave Nosi Be and go straight to the East,
there will be a great break in my letters and telegrams.
Do not be anxious. It is quite normal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
as we have before us a voyage which, under favourable
conditions, lasts twenty days.</p>

<p>To-day I indulged myself and drank some kvass<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
in the <i>Aurora</i>. I stayed there some time. Many
officers are sceptical, and do not believe that we
shall go to the East.</p>

<p>Wrangles are beginning. Two of the captains
of torpedo-boats quarrelled as to where they were
to lie for coaling. One of them was so much insulted
that he went to the <i>Suvaroff</i> in his torpedo-boat
to complain. No sooner was this story done
than another began. The flagship's torpedo officer,
who had a number of monkeys, received an order
to rid the ship of these animals (he had a cabin full
of them). This order was brought out owing to a
report from the senior staff-officer, in whose cabin
one of the monkeys had been and made himself at
home. They contradicted each other in the flag-captain's
cabin, and the story promises to be played
out. In the evening an officer of the <i>Suvaroff</i> shouted
out something to the <i>Oslyabya</i>, who did not notice a
peace attack of torpedo-boats. In the <i>Oslyabya</i> they
are anxious to know the name of the officer. There
will probably be a complaint to the staff to-morrow.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>
<p><i>February 17th.</i>&mdash;I do not know how the quarrel
of the torpedo captains has ended. One of them
came to the staff to-day with explanations.</p>

<p><i>February 19th.</i>&mdash;I have bought myself about
2,000 cigarettes. They are without mouthpieces.
The tobacco is black and the taste indifferent. If
I cannot get Russian ones I must content myself
with these.</p>

<p>I had to go on board the <i>Borodino</i> late this
evening. It was not very pleasant. Frequently
the challenge of the sentries in the ships which
we have to pass is not heard, owing to the
noise of the water and the steam. They fire
instantly if the boat does not give the countersign.</p>

<p>Some telegram from Europe was posted up at
the post-office. The Governor ordered it to be
taken down, so that Russian officers should not
read it. Can it be another terrible misfortune?
The telegrams that remained announced that the
Japanese had cut off Vladivostok almost completely.
There are hardly any war stores in Vladivostok.
Four steamers were sent from there to Port Arthur
while it was holding out, and all fell into the hands
of the Japanese. They are taking the guns from
Port Arthur and are fortifying the coast of Korea
with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Where can our fleet go if Vladivostok is cut
off? Even if we succeed in getting there before
it is captured, there are no stores there, and in the
fleet there are few. We starving shall come to
the famished. The fleet will then perish, as it did
at Port Arthur. Do you know that the <i>Bogatyr</i>
sank while coming out of dock? They were able
to place a floating dock under her. The Japanese
have sent cruisers and torpedo-boats to Vladivostok.
Matters are going badly for Kuropatkin.</p>

<p>Have you heard that Japan and France have
concluded the following agreement? Our fleet can
remain at Nosi Be as long as it is convenient, but if
it leaves even for only three days, then it shall not
have the right to enter a French port for three
months.</p>

<p>Yes, it must be admitted the situation of
Russia is desperate. There are many things I
cannot tell you of on paper. They would not improve
the general outlook. The <i>Esperanza</i>, which
is lying at Mojanga, has prepared to come here
four times, and each time her machinery has
been damaged. Evidently her crew have done it
purposely.</p>

<p>I received your telegram to-day. In it is one
word, "Well"; at all events, I know you are alive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Since the beginning of December our Admiralty
has not sent us a single letter.</p>

<p>I went to church to-day. It is the memorial day
of those warriors who laid down their lives on the
field of battle.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock I set out for the <i>Borodino</i>. I
was induced to put on my dirk. I never wear it,
but hung it on for this occasion. In going down the
ladder I caught it on something. It came out,
fell into the water, and sank in twelve fathoms.
It is impossible to get it. An engineer in the
<i>Borodino</i> promised to make me a dummy handle.
I shall wear it fastened to the scabbard, so that
it will look all right. Of course, a proper dirk is
not to be had here.</p>

<p>There was a very grand and gay lunch in the
<i>Borodino</i>. They decorated the wardroom, covered
the deck with carpets, and arranged plants in every
corner. They laid the table in the form of the
letter &pi; (p), placed flower-pots on them, and
scattered flowers on the table-cloth. In front of
each place was an illuminated menu. There were
many guests. The band played. They are a very
happy ship. They are always joking, laughing,
and amusing themselves, and yet they never forget
their duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>After lunch had been reduced to fragments,
the wine flowed in streams. They stationed the
band close to the wardroom. Several officers
conducted the band themselves. They played my
beloved Little Russian march. At first I drank
nothing, but having eaten my fill, and sitting listening
to the band and hearing the march, I began to
drink champagne. Many were drinking it, and
with each glass I remembered how you feared I
should take to drink. Several officers began to
dance. At six o'clock I returned to my ship.</p>

<p>The mail-steamer <i>Esperanza</i> has arrived. There
were very few letters for the fleet. There was
only one bag, and that was sent by Günsburg
(agents). From the newspapers we learn what is
going on in Russia, and the orders of our Ministry
about killed and wounded, etc. I cannot speak
calmly. My anger rises, and I am ready to do
God knows what! How I curse myself for having
come!</p>

<p><i>February 23rd.</i>&mdash;At last the <i>Irtish</i> has been
found. She left Jibutil on the 17th, so will be here
on the 27th or 28th. If only a mail could be brought
by her, but our Ministry would never have thought
that they could send letters to Jibutil up to the 17th.
From there the <i>Irtish</i> could have brought them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
to the fleet. Although there is little hope of this,
I shall await her arrival with impatience.</p>

<p><i>February 24th.</i>&mdash;I have just returned from the
harbour. I am very much pleased with the work
of the divers in the <i>Jemchug</i>; they have carried it out
brilliantly. I was rather doubtful of success at
first. I asked that a letter should be written to
the admiral about the successful work of the officers
and divers who took part in it. The captain promised
to do so, and I for my part undertook to
put in a few words.</p>

<p>Some home-made kvass has made its appearance
in the <i>Suvaroff</i>. I drink it incessantly. It
is indifferent kvass, but at least it is Russian. A
boy from the <i>Borodino</i>, whose name I do not remember,
has just come to ask me to help him gain permission
to be examined for the rank of petty officer.</p>

<p>I am preparing myself to go ashore at three
o'clock. I shall call at the post-office, walk through
the streets, and freshen myself up. The shore at
least is a change, however dull it may be.</p>

<p><i>February 26th.</i>&mdash;The Malagassy are beginning
to be impertinent in offering their services. Europeans
do not stand on much ceremony with them.
When they saw me with a parcel in my hands, a
crowd rushed to the verandah of the shop. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
European clerk grew angry, jumped up, and kicked
them like dogs. It did not disconcert them in the
least.</p>

<p>At the post-office I was given telegrams and
local letters for the fleet. Among the letters
was a postcard for Admiral Rojdestvensky. On
it the Germans were jeering at him about the
North Sea affair, and advising him to return, "the
more so as they have prepared vodky for you."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>At three o'clock a wireless message was received
from the <i>Irtish</i>. At eight she arrived in the harbour.
There is scarcely a line in her. The cursed staff
have not sent the mail by her, although they might
easily have done so. The <i>Irtish</i> was lying at
Jibutil for nearly a month. How every one abused
the staff! Can you wonder at it, when even the
chief of the staff himself sends letters to his son by
Günsburg. How can we fight Japan when they
cannot arrange such a simple matter as sending
the mails? We have not received a word from
home for two and a half months, thanks to their
negligence in not putting two and two together.
If they cannot do this much that is absolutely
necessary for the moral welfare of the personnel
of the fleet, how are they to contend against an
enterprising foe like Japan? Knowing their disposition,
I little expected to receive anything by
the <i>Irtish</i>; but others were certain that there
would be a very large mail. Their disappointment
is very great. The first officer of the <i>Irtish</i> went
mad, and was sent back to Russia from Suez. I
hope to go on board her to-morrow, and must also
go to the <i>Borodino</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<p><i>February 27th.</i>&mdash;I counted on getting cigarettes
in the <i>Irtish</i>, but there were none. They required
them themselves.</p>

<p>In many ships they have mass on the upper
deck. I saw two such services to-day&mdash;in the
<i>Oslyabya</i> and the <i>Borodino</i>. I found my way
to the latter and remained to lunch. They
had pancakes, with smetana.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> I conversed with
the captain a long time, and returned to the <i>Suvaroff</i>
at two o'clock.</p>

<p>A theatrical troupe has been got up on board
the <i>Borodino</i>, consisting of ten sailors. They are
frequently invited to other ships to give plays.</p>

<p>How they are cursing the General Staff about
the mail! In several ships they want to telegraph
to the <i>Novoe Vremya</i> that the officers
request their relations and friends to send their
letters through Günsburg's agency at Odessa.
Some day I will tell you the part that Günsburg
has played in the history of the war. Without
him all would have been lost. He provided drink,
food, and necessaries for the whole fleet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>
<p>News has been received that Mukden has been
taken by the Japanese, that the road on the flank
of the army has been cut, that we have lost 50,000
killed and wounded and 50,000 prisoners. A fearful
catastrophe! At the present condition of affairs
the war may be considered lost. We must expect
every minute to hear that Vladivostok is either
besieged or taken. It is useless for the fleet to go
on. Poor Russia, when will your trials be ended?
One misfortune brings forth another.</p>

<p><i>February 28th.</i>&mdash;It is creditably asserted that
from Europe and America they are taking shells,
ammunition, guns, armour, and provisions to
Japan, and there are even steamers loaded with
only milk. Large flotillas of transports are on
their way thither. The Japanese navy and army
are furnished in abundance with every necessary.
Supplies are procured in an unbroken flow.</p>

<p>Russia is a contrast to Japan. In Manchuria
our troops are starving, cold&mdash;not clothed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
barefooted; guns and projectiles are scarce. And
our fleet&mdash;it is ludicrous even to compare it with the
Japanese! We are now lying waiting the arrival
of Günsburg's steamer <i>Regina</i>, which should bring
some provisions. One steamer! and our foe has
ten!</p>

<p>I am no prophet, but remember my words. In
the middle of March Japan will be master of the
island of Sagalien, and in April, if not sooner,
will besiege Vladivostok, or effect a landing close by.
Is it worth while sending our fleet to the East? Let
us suppose Vladivostok holds out until our arrival,
and that our fleet, after having engaged in battle
with the Japanese, reaches it. What then? At
Vladivostok there is little coal; there are no shells,
powder, or guns; and how many shall we have left
after the fight? Again, the Japanese ships after
the fight would go to Sasebo, Nagasaki, and other
ports; and, quickly repairing their damages, would
be ready to fight again. What should we do?
At Vladivostok there is only one dock. There are
no good workshops, no materials, no workmen.
It is quite enough to remember how long they took
repairing the <i>Gromoboi</i> and <i>Bogatyr</i>. Vladivostok
will be a second Port Arthur. All this is supposing
that Vladivostok can hold out, and that the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of the fight will be the same for us as for the Japanese.
It must not be forgotten that we have to go into
action with a crew wearied by a tremendous voyage,
and that we have to defend our transports, etc.</p>

<p>Perhaps the <i>Regina</i> will bring us a mail. We
expect her in a few days.</p>

<p>I examined the places in the <i>Aurora</i> that were
struck by projectiles at the time of the North Sea
incident. One of the projectiles turned at nearly
a right angle during its destructive flight.</p>

<p>The heat is considerable. How accurately I
have calculated the time! I reckoned that on
March 1st the fleet would be at Vladivostok. It
appears that I was not far wrong. Had it not been
for the misfortunes at Port Arthur and on land,
we should, according to secret plans, have been
approaching Vladivostok on March 1st. In the
programme which I worked out in Russia I only
made an error of a few days.</p>

<p>In Japan they are hastily finishing the construction
of a large cruiser. By the middle of March
a large number of gunboats will be prepared, which
can be made use of in the Amur river.</p>

<p>I was specially sent for to the <i>Kamchatka</i> about
her rudder. I thought God knows what had happened,
and it turned out to be a trifle. There was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
great show in the wardroom in the evening. A
rat hunt was organised, and many killed. It is a
relaxation from care. For a long time they carried
on a successful hunt, in which the ship's dogs took
a part.</p>

<p><i>March 1st.</i>&mdash;We might get a mail by the <i>Regina</i>,
which arrives on the 5th. We have begun active
preparations for a very long cruise. It will be
very sad if we go without waiting for the mails.
In any case, the fleet should wait for the <i>Regina</i>.
It is impossible to move forward without the provisions
which are coming in her. We are evidently
not intended to wait for the third fleet. Why do
they spend more money for nothing by sending it?
If our fleet loses the battle, can the third fleet
continue its voyage independently? Even if the
battle is indecisive in its results, it is impossible for
it to go to the East. A signal has been made for
all ships to be ready to get up anchor in twenty-four
hours. The <i>Regina</i> has not come yet.</p>

<p>The <i>Suvaroff</i> was built in the Baltic shipyard.
How often have I looked at her! Sometimes, even,
with ill will. Perhaps I had then a presentiment
that my fate would be closely bound up with
hers.</p>

<p>I will send my letters by a boat going ashore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
I do not know if I shall be able to leave the ship
myself. I feel much calmer when my letters are
posted. I have made a new reckoning of time.
I made out that we can be at Vladivostok in a
month and a half after leaving here, if there are
no delays on the way. That means that, if nothing
happens, and the fleet leaves here soon, we shall
see each other at the beginning of May.</p>

<p><i>March 2nd.</i>&mdash;The <i>Regina</i> is near. She has
entered the harbour and will soon anchor. Possibly
we shall weigh anchor to-morrow and go eastward.
Do not be anxious that there will be no letters
from me for a long time. Under favourable conditions
the voyage to the East Indian Archipelago
takes three weeks. The <i>Regina</i> has brought part
of the post. The other part, for some reason, was
left at Port Said.</p>

<p>A signal has been made for us to have steam
ready by twelve noon, on March 3rd.</p>

<p>I think we shall go from Nosi Be to Saigon. The
voyage will be long and wearisome, whatever the
weather may be.</p>

<p>There is such hellish heat in my cabin that I am
now sitting writing in the after-cabin. People are
scribbling in every corner. I can imagine what it
will be at the post-office to-morrow. We do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
weigh anchor before noon. Before then it will be
necessary to post the letters from all the ships of
the fleet, and there are more than forty of them.
I have finished all my necessary work in the ships
in time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

ACROSS THE INDIAN OCEAN</h2>


<p><i>March 3rd.</i>&mdash;Leaving Nosi Be; in the Indian
Ocean.</p>

<p>To-day was full of events. This morning I went
on shore to send my letters and help dispatch others.
There was a large crowd at the post-office. All were
hurrying to get rid of their letters by eleven, when
there is a cessation of work there until two o'clock.
At noon the order was given to be ready to get up
anchor. Many people did not succeed in posting
valuable packets, parcels, and registered letters.
The latter they threw straight into the letter-box,
which was instantly filled, and had constantly to
be emptied.</p>

<p>I was not looking, and the officer who was
with me took my registered letters and put them
in the box. I was at that moment putting on
stamps for transmission abroad. I was annoyed.
I went round the post-office into the back yard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and through a window to a room where they were
receiving the letters. I induced a Malagassy to
take all the letters out of the box and look for mine,
which among the general heap came into my hands.
I gave all the letters to a clerk, begging him to send
them to Russia registered. I had no time to wait
for a receipt. I had to hurry on board. I had the
advantage of being known to the clerks&mdash;firstly
because I had often had business with them, and
secondly because I promised them medals and
orders. Representations about this are already
made. At the post-office they asked me questions
like this: "Are you leaving to-day or to-morrow?
Are you going straight to Russia from here?" By
eleven o'clock I was on board.</p>

<p>It was hard to imagine what was going on this
morning on the quay. Everything was quite
covered by goods and provisions. Carts with
bullocks harnessed to them constantly brought
loads. All were hastening with packages to the
boats. They were hurriedly closing accounts with
the shore.</p>

<p>Lunch passed off quietly, but then came my
benefit. Forgive me; I will tell you the rest to-morrow.
I am so tired I can scarcely sit. I
slept badly last night, and do not feel well. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
servant even said, "Look here, your worship, sleep
and rest. You have slept very little while at the
anchorage, and worked hard." That is true. There
has been plenty of work. I shall rest now, if nothing
happens to the ships, which God forbid. Here we
are, again on our way. The place where we are
going is still kept secret.</p>

<p><i>March 4th.</i>&mdash;I must finish my story of yesterday.
Soon after lunch news was received from the <i>Kamchatka</i>
that her condenser did not work. She also
reported that a Kingston valve had been torn out,
that she was beginning to fill with water, and that
they were putting a mat under. I thought they
would send me to the <i>Kamchatka</i> and keep me there
for the whole voyage. I was sent for by the admiral.
I went to the <i>Kamchatka</i>, and found horror and
confusion reigning there. In the engine-room compartment
the water was already breast-high. I
managed to put it right somehow. It happened
that the Kingston was not torn out, but the flap
in the Kingston pipe was damaged. They shut the
flap, not taking precautionary measures, and ejected
it out of the pipe, and water came in through the
opening formed. When the danger passed I returned
to the <i>Suvaroff</i>. The admiral sent me to
the <i>Kamchatka</i>, to remain until the work was finished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
I went there in the duty steamboat. I sent it back
and returned in a rowing-boat to the <i>Suvaroff</i>, where
another surprise awaited me. They were unable to
hoist the steamboat in the <i>Aurora</i>. The davits were
damaged.</p>

<p>I hastened there. In all the other ships the
boats were already hoisted. I set out for the
<i>Aurora</i> in the admiral's light whaler, which is usually
hoisted at the last moment. Every moment was
valuable. We had to hurry. The men pulled with
all their might. At all costs the <i>Aurora's</i> steamboat
had to be hoisted, otherwise it would have
had to be left behind. The work was strenuous.
They hammered, filed, and bound, rove the falls,
and the boat was eventually hoisted. I was annoyed
at having dirtied myself.</p>

<p>You may imagine the need there was to hurry.
All this business began at twelve o'clock, and it
was necessary that the fleet should weigh anchor at
three o'clock. Weigh anchor! and the <i>Kamchatka</i>
sinking and a steamboat not able to be hoisted!
Besides this, there was a report from the <i>Kamchatka</i>
in the morning that there was a breakage in her
steering arrangements. I took it on myself to say
that she could go with such damages. Nevertheless,
I was able to put everything to rights by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
half-past two. I breathed freely. The signal was
hoisted, and we began to get up anchor.</p>

<p>The starting of the fleet was a pretty sight.
There were forty-two ships, if you count torpedo-boats
and transports. French torpedo-boats came
to escort the fleet. They wished us a prosperous
voyage, and cheered. Our bands played the
Marseillaise. Excitement reigns in the wardroom.
Will it be for long? Am I pleased? I cannot
understand my own feelings. On one hand I
am anxious about the fate of the fleet; on the
other, there is the possibility of seeing you soon,
and the feeble, feeble hope of beating the Japanese
fleet. If by any chance that should happen, Russia
will have command of the sea, and the battle-scenes
on land will be changed in our favour. If we are
beaten&mdash;then Japan is strong, very strong.</p>

<p>You know the steamer <i>Regina</i> came to us. At
the instance of Japan part of the provisions and
supplies were unloaded from her at Port Said. How
pleased you will be at this! It means that if Japan
had wished it, the <i>Regina</i> would not have come here
at all. We only receive what Japan permits. See
what strength this small country exhibits! It is
all thanks to her success in the war.</p>

<p>Just imagine the astonishment of Admiral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Nebogatoff's fleet when they learn that we have gone
on without waiting for them. In my opinion it is a
rash step to divide your forces. It would not have
taken much longer waiting for that fleet, as we have
already waited two and a half months at Madagascar.</p>

<p>A flag-officer of our staff has received some secret
appointment. He remained at Nosi Be, and was
advanced two and a half months' pay.</p>

<p>When Lieutenant Radekin was at Diego Suarez
the French told him the date of our departure from
Nosi Be and of our further course. That was on
February 24th. Radekin wrote down the prediction,
sealed it, and gave it to me to be opened at
sea. Just fancy, the date of our departure was
given exactly! The course I cannot verify, as I do
not know it myself.</p>

<p>Yesterday, when it grew dark, the ships lit their
lights. The sky was brilliant with flashing stars.
Forty-five ships! What a grand armada! How
difficult it is to direct its movements, and what an
enormous extent it occupies! The admiral only left
the bridge at nine o'clock. We were then exceedingly
hungry, and sat down to dinner. Last evening
delays began immediately. The battleship <i>Orel</i>
reported that some of her machinery was broken.
The fleet lessened speed, and the <i>Orel</i> steamed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
one engine. Something then went wrong with the
<i>Anadir's</i> machinery. We waited a whole hour while
she put it right. To-day all are going successfully.
I have noticed that for some reason the tale of
damages usually begins at night.</p>

<p>To-day it is gloomy. The sun is not visible.
The sea is rather rough. God forbid that we should
have bad weather, especially during the first nine
days. All the ships are heavily encumbered with
coal. There is not a spot on deck free of coal.
This has a bad effect on the sea-going qualities of
ships.</p>

<p>I lay down to rest, but could not sleep owing to
the heat. I forget if I told you I sleep completely
uncovered, and keep a small piece of cardboard by
me and use it as a fan. Some one has made a bag
out of two nets, and is catching fish from the stern
gallery. The weather is calm, and a great many
fish swim after the ship.</p>

<p>Nearly alongside the <i>Suvaroff</i> is the torpedo-boat
<i>Biedovy</i>.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Life in the torpedo-boat is passed on
deck. From the ship we can see how they dine and
all that is going on.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>
<p>Yesterday a sailor from the <i>Kieff</i> flung himself
into the sea and was drowned. What was his
mental condition? Was he afraid that he would
be killed. How strange it is! But I have heard
that there are instances when men, fearing to
be killed in action, put an end to themselves.
Probably the fear of death acts so strongly
on these men that they are not themselves. An
hour ago a sailor in a fever threw himself overboard
from the <i>Jemchug</i>. They lowered two whalers and
a gig to pick him up, and threw him a life-belt; but
he fortunately swam to the hospital-ship <i>Orel</i> and
climbed on board. Now he is remaining in her.</p>

<p><i>March 5th</i> (morning).&mdash;Last evening something
went wrong with the machinery of the transport
<i>Vladimir</i>. We waited while it was repaired. On
the whole we are going very slowly. This morning
all the torpedo-boats but one (the duty boat) were
taken in tow. This was in order that they should
not expend coal, which is very difficult to supply in
mid-ocean even when it is comparatively calm.
In slightly rough weather it is useless even to think
of coaling.</p>

<p>Last evening a German steamer from Diego
Suarez, as she explained on being asked, overtook
and passed us. This is rather suspicious.
Why must she go on the same course as we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
going? The route for the fleet was purposely
chosen, being one along which no one ever goes.
Yesterday the <i>Navarin</i> fired to try the carriage of
newly placed guns. The sound of the firing reached
the <i>Suvaroff</i>. This, I thought, is how I shall hear
the firing when we meet the Japanese. The sounds
are not very loud. Our shots, no doubt, will make
more noise.</p>

<p>Slowly, very slowly, we are going ahead. Now
and then the fleet stops, and goes on again with a
speed of five to eight knots. There are varieties
of mishaps, breakages in the <i>Sissoi</i>, and in the
torpedo-boats <i>Grosny</i> and <i>Gromky</i>. The slightest
damage delays all. Do you know to what distance
our ships extend, going in several divisions? Nearly
ten versts. If we go on at the same speed we shall
expend a great deal of time before reaching any port.
We are going north-east, and are again approaching
the equator.</p>

<p>The ship scouting reported that she saw a light
far away. Perhaps a "chance" vessel, like the one
yesterday. In a good cruiser the Japanese might
watch every step of our fleet without being perceived
by us. We are steaming with lights. What
is to prevent a fast cruiser, without lights, from
approaching us, ascertaining our position, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
disappearing&mdash;and no one will ever suspect such
observation. If the Japanese do not do that now,
it is almost certain that they will watch our fleet
when approaching the islands of the East Indian
archipelago, in order that, having chosen a favourable
time, they may attack, if not the warships, at
all events the transports. It is very difficult to
defend the latter.</p>

<p>What is Nebogatoff's fleet doing now? Will they
really continue their voyage to the East? It will
be a great risk.</p>

<p><i>March 6th</i> (morning).&mdash;In the night we remained
three hours at one spot. Something was amiss
with the steering engine of the <i>Borodino</i>. She has
not yet put it right, and so is going on the flanks of
the rest.</p>

<p>A steamer is coming towards us.</p>

<p>The light which the scouting cruiser saw yesterday,
and which she took for a ship, proved to be a star.
They say you can often make the mistake, seeing
a star setting on the horizon. I saw one like it.
Sometimes there is a completely deceptive appearance
of a ship's light. It is related that on one
occasion, during the last war with Turkey, a whole
fleet (in the Black Sea) chased a star. No doubt
the mistake was soon found out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>During the cruise life on board passes very
monotonously. There are no events except breakages.
All are tired of one another. They converse
little and about nothing, and sit in different
corners. I have not been much in the wardroom
lately. I do not play games or the pianola. I sit
mostly in the deck-house, on the bridge, or in the
flag-captain's cabin.</p>

<p>There was mass to-day. The weather has become
a little rougher. We are going desperately slowly,
so shall not reach a port soon. We have to cross
a whole ocean. Another pleasure is in store for the
fleet&mdash;coaling in the open sea.</p>

<p><i>Night.</i>&mdash;The whole port side of the spar-deck is
occupied by oxen and cows. The oxen for meat
and the cows for milk, only unfortunately the latter
do not give any. There are two calves. It is
decided to feed them. They will probably die. In
the transports special stalls have been made for the
animals, so that they can endure the motion. There
are none of these stalls in the battleships, and the
oxen have to stand on deck.</p>

<p><i>March 7th</i> (morning).&mdash;Our voyage is continued
to the Chagos Islands, past the chief island, Diego
Garcia. There were rumours that Japanese ships
were lying at the Chagos archipelago, which belongs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to England. The rumour may be true. Perhaps
there will be a collision near these islands. The
Chagos archipelago consists of small, thinly populated
islands. There is no telegraph cable joining
it to the mainland.</p>

<p>There is an artificer in the <i>Suvaroff</i> called Krimmer.
He is a very trustworthy man. I once
offered to exchange letters in the event of the
death of one of us. To-day he handed me an
envelope with the following superscription: "In
the event of my death I beg you to send the enclosed
letter to its address, and also to dispatch the things
I leave behind. G. Krimmer, 2/3/1905. In the
<i>Kniaz Suvaroff</i>." I have not prepared my letter yet.
And what can I say in it? I have no secrets from
you. You know everything and what I might say
to you in my last moments.</p>

<p>The route we are following now is little frequented
by ships. Never since the creation of the world
have battleships, small cruisers, torpedo-boats, or
a fleet at all similar to ours gone along this route.
What sort of ship is there not with us? Battleships,
cruisers, torpedo-boats, transports, a repair ship,
hospital-ship, a water-carrier, and a tug.</p>

<p>Again the fleet has stopped. The tow-rope of
one of the torpedo-boats has broken. We are going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
slowly. To-day at noon we have done 675 miles, in
all about 1,180 versts, and we have to do 7,000
versts in order to reach the East Indian archipelago.
At 4 a.m. to-morrow all warships are to coal from
the transports which are with us.</p>

<p><i>March 8th.</i>&mdash;I have been unable to write since
this morning. In the first place, I was going from
ship to ship; then there was such an infernal heat
in my cabin that it was useless to think of writing.
It is a little fresher now, 27° R. In the night
the tiller rope carried away in the <i>Suvaroff</i>; the
confusion was considerable, but I escaped it.</p>

<p>I was called early this morning, at seven o'clock.
All the fleet had stopped and begun to take coal
from the boats, which were loaded from the transports.
At first the weather was calm, although
there was a fairly large swell. The <i>Aurora's</i> steamboat
disturbed me. They had hoisted it in, but
I had not seen how they secured it. I wanted to
see it myself. The <i>Roland</i> went about with various
orders for ships that were far from the <i>Suvaroff</i>.
I decided to go in her to the <i>Aurora</i>.</p>

<p>I went in the admiral's whaler and began to
curse myself. Getting out of the whaler was very
dangerous and difficult. The <i>Roland</i> had to deliver
packets with orders to ten ships, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
eleven o'clock she had just been to six. The ships
lay far off, and much time was spent in sending
boats with the packets. At twelve o'clock I
returned to the <i>Suvaroff</i> from the <i>Roland</i> in the
whaler again. Could you have believed that I
should ever be pulled across the ocean in a tiny
cockleshell?</p>

<p>The swell is an extraordinary thing. It looks
quite calm from a ship, but in reality it is far from
being so. I drank a cup of coffee in the <i>Roland</i>.</p>

<p>At first she rolled lightly, but afterwards to such
an extent that the plates fell from the table. When
we came near the different ships they looked at us
with curiosity, expected something, and asked the
news, as if we were not in the same fleet. They were
given the packets, and their disappointment was
fearful. I was late for lunch and ate in my cabin.
When I entered it from the fresh air, it seemed like
a stove. The heat was intolerable. I drank water
with ice in it. A piece was left. With the greatest
delight I rubbed my head and neck with it. I
often do this now. The ice melts instantly.</p>

<p>I went to the after-cabin; landed myself there on
a sofa to doze a little, but it was not to be. I had
begun to sleep when an orderly came and said the
admiral required me. The torpedo-boat <i>Buistry</i> had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
dented her side slightly, broken a boat, etc. When
I had finished with her I again went to the sofa in
the after-cabin.</p>

<p>The coaling will soon be stopped. The ships
are moving their engines, and we shall proceed!
It will be difficult in the swell to hoist steam and
other boats on board. The weather was indifferent;
but contrary to expectation, the coaling
was fairly successful. Perhaps they will begin it
again to-morrow morning. The fleet does not
anchor, but only lies with engines stopped. The
wind and sea continually bring ships towards each
other. Up to now, thank God! everything was
all right, with the exception of the <i>Buistry</i>. She
ought not to have been brought. She broke up at
Revel, knocked her side in at the Skaw, and now
she has collided with a transport. We went on
again twenty minutes ago. Dinner was late again.
I have not been invited to the dining-room.</p>

<p>A curious impression is produced by the boxes
or barrels fastened to the masts of the cruisers for
the look-out men. Some of the cruisers have
fastened cages, like boxes, and others have simply
suspended barrels. In these boxes and barrels
signalmen stand and watch the horizon.</p>

<p>They are hung up very high. Without them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
sailors might easily fall from the mast. Only the
heads and shoulders of the signalmen are visible
now. A monotonous journey again stretches before
us. Do you know how the officers in the wardroom
amuse themselves all the evening? They
make the dog listen to the gramaphone. Several
pieces did not please her, and she began to howl.
This employment seemed very funny to many.
The gramaphone was purposely placed on deck, and
the trumpet directed straight at the dog.</p>

<p>Nights of alarm have again begun. They suspect
the near presence of Japanese cruisers, which
have a base in the English Seychelles Islands,
by which we are now passing.</p>

<p>At the wireless telegraph office they are receiving
strange dispatches. There are more grounds for
caution now than there ever were before. No
doubt as the fleet moves forward the chances of
a meeting with the enemy increase. All day I felt
fairly well, but towards the evening a strange
depression came over me. Anxiety wrings my
heart. I have lost all interest in everything. They
say that the Japanese are near. What then? It
is all the same to me.</p>

<p>I often pass through bad moments. One
grieves, rages, censures, criticises, and condemns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
everything. Our army is acting independently, and
the fleet does not combine with the movements
of the army. The self-same fleet is split into
little pieces, which do not act in conformity with
the movements of the others. Three (or now,
perhaps, two) ships are doing something, or
more probably are lying at Vladivostok. Our
fleet is moving east, and the third remains behind
somewhere (where we do not know); and they are
collecting some remnants at Cronstadt and Libau.
All these parts do not know what the others are
doing. Can there be success under these conditions?
I think that there are many disorders in the army.
There is no method or organisation anywhere.
Among our enemies all is worked out, foreseen, and
guessed beforehand. They conduct war on a
scientific programme. Is success likely to be on
our side? No.</p>

<p>Of course, anything might happen. We might
win, but it would only be by chance. With
us it is the old system called "Perhaps," and
the old game of trusting to luck. Everything is
done anyhow. Not without reason some one
remarked that the "apes were righting the anyhows."
To do him justice, it would be difficult to
say a worse or a truer thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Oleg</i> is steaming astern, and other cruisers
are ahead and abeam of the fleet. All the battleships,
torpedo-boats, and transports occupy the
centre.</p>

<p><i>March 9th</i> (8 a.m.).&mdash;Six times to-day the tow-ropes
of torpedo-boats have carried away. This
is rather often. The <i>Dimitry Donskoi</i> reports that
at night she saw lights of three ships, which were
communicating with searchlight flashes, and were
going the same course as ourselves.</p>

<p>Another sailor has died in the <i>Oslyabya</i>. He
will be buried at sea. He died the day before
yesterday, but the coaling prevented his body
being committed to the deep yesterday. There
are frequent deaths in the <i>Oslyabya</i>, and most of
them occur when the fleet is under way.</p>

<p>The admiral always had weak nerves, and now
especially so. He sleeps very little, is worried,
and gets beside himself at every trifle. Probably
he will not hold out to the end.</p>

<p>11 p.m.&mdash;We are going desperately slowly. So
far we have made a thousand miles. If we go
by one course there will be 2,800 miles left, and by
another 2,500. This means we have to toss on the
sea for fifteen or twenty days, if nothing happens.</p>

<p>At every step there are breakages and damages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
This evening the <i>Sissoi</i> damaged first her rudder
and then her machinery. The tow-ropes of the
torpedo-boats break like threads. The <i>Buistry</i> has
again distinguished herself. She has broken a
gun-platform. Soon there will be nothing to break
in her.</p>

<p>In the wardroom they reckon that we have
4,400 miles to do in thirty-four days. Our provisions
are finished, and we shall have to take to
salt provisions (horrid filth). They make jokes,
selecting which of the officers shall be eaten first.</p>

<p>To-morrow it is proposed to coal. It will be
difficult to do so if the swell is as great as it was
to-day. Again we shall lose a whole day. Coaling
in our present condition is a very important thing,
though troublesome. The whole deck is encumbered
with coal, and even part of the guns.</p>

<p><i>March 10th.</i>&mdash;At nine the torpedo-boat <i>Gromky</i>
reported that her rudder was damaged. The
divers had to work under water, and there were
many sharks. While they were at work men with
loaded rifles stood ready to defend them. They
were clearly visible, as the water is very transparent.</p>

<p>9 p.m.&mdash;From a chance word I gathered that in
fifteen days we shall be at some port. I doubt it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
By my reckoning we shall toss at sea much longer.
Slowly, very slowly, we go on. Stoppages are
constant. I am so accustomed to them that I
take very little interest in knowing the reason,
and am too lazy to go on deck and find out.</p>

<p><i>March 11th.</i>&mdash;The <i>Svietlana</i> reports that she sees
a steamer ahead on the same course as ourselves.
It is strange that we are going slowly along an unfrequented
route and yet we can catch up a steamer.
Even freight-steamers do not go as slowly as our
ships.</p>

<p><i>March 12th.</i>&mdash;The <i>Oleg</i> and <i>Donskoi</i> report that
they see some lights far away. They are watching
them. Perhaps they are English cruisers. The
steamer which the <i>Svietlana</i> saw was apparently a
myth. A boiler in the <i>Kamchatka</i> is damaged, but
she does not remain behind. She began to drop,
but when she knew about the suspicious light she
prepared to come on. We are approaching nearer
and nearer to the East.</p>

<p>We shall soon recross the equator. Vladivostok
seems like the promised land. Yes; Vladivostok,
Vladivostok!</p>

<p>But what if my supposition about Sagalien and
Vladivostok are justified? Where will our fleet
go then, and what will it do? The next time we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
stop to coal I shall have to pass the whole day on
board the <i>Gromky</i>.</p>

<p>They have stopped breaking the tow-ropes in the
torpedo-boats. At all events, they have not broken
one for some time.</p>

<p>The <i>Sissoi</i> is keeping back the fleet. There is
always something wrong with her. This morning the
<i>Nachimoff</i> joined her. The <i>Oleg</i> reports that the
lights she saw yesterday were not constant. They
looked like sparks flying out of funnels. Perhaps
our fleet is following in the wake of some other
ships. By day they hide themselves beyond the
horizon, so we do not see them; and by night they
approach us, having all lights out. The sparks
betray their presence. At night, when there is
no moon, it is absolutely dark and very difficult
to see.</p>

<p>Our fleet is steaming with lights visible from
afar; therefore it is easy for ships knowing our
course to find the fleet in the ocean and to approach
it without danger. We may expect any moment
to be attacked at night. I cannot without horror
imagine one thing&mdash;that is, that they will compel
us to lie an endless number of days in some
Saigon.</p>

<p>Then what will happen? I calm myself with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
thought that they will not allow this, observing
neutrality.</p>

<p>Neutrality is a fine word. It is good and convenient
only for the strong. Strength is now on
Japan's side, and neutrality serves her interests
and is useful to her.</p>

<p>They say that the admiral declared that if he
met a Japanese ship in neutral waters he would
destroy her, remembering the capture of the <i>Reshitelny</i>
(Decisive) by the Japanese. There is neutrality
for you! I did not myself hear Rojdestvensky say
this&mdash;but knowing his character, think him quite
capable of it. However, this will not happen. The
Japanese are wily. They will not separate their
ships, as Russia has done. God forbid that Japan
beats our fleet! The might of Russia will perish
with it for ten years. The fleet will not be reconstructed
for long. But if we beat the Japanese
at sea and get command of it, then Japan is ruined.
She will be unable to carry on war, and will not be
able to feed and provide the army.</p>

<p>In Japan itself there will be nothing to eat. It
can scarcely happen so. Even if the mastery of the
sea remains with us, England and America will
defend Japan, and Russia will retire, fearing war
with these two countries. The war is bound to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
end to Russia's disadvantage. How much money
she has wasted! How many men have perished!&mdash;and
for what?</p>

<p>Shame! Shame! We wallow in shame! How
we jeered at the English during their war with the
Boers, at the Italians during their Abyssinian campaign!
I do not know what is going on in Manchuria,
but judging by the time that passed between the
battles of Liao-Yang and Mukden the next great
fight will take place in August or September,&mdash;in the
event of the Japanese not moving beyond Mukden
and acting as they have hitherto done&mdash;that is, very
carefully.</p>

<p>By August or September Russia might collect
an army.</p>

<p>Where is now the supply depot of our land forces?
In Harbin? It may be that they will have to leave
it and retire again. Yesterday I heard a quarrel
among the sub-lieutenants about how many stokeholds
there were in the <i>Suvaroff</i>, and how the boilers
were placed. Officers who had been in the ship a
year, and who had, by order of the admiral, kept
watch in the stokehold, were quarrelling over these
things. How sad it was, and yet I could not listen
to them without laughing! The Japanese doubtless
know our ships better than we do ourselves. Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
you remember what I said before the departure of
the fleet? From the very beginning of the voyage
I have seen so many instances confirming my former
opinions. I do not believe in the fleet, however
many ships are in it, and however much they count
on them. It is a small matter to possess warships.
It is necessary to profit by their strength. Possibly
the Japanese fleet might be beaten, but it would only
be by chance.</p>

<p><i>March 13th.</i>&mdash;To-day is Sunday. There will be
mass. I must go to church&mdash;the service is just
beginning. I have not been at all well.</p>

<p>I slept a great deal to-day, and was punished for
it. I slept in my bunk, leaving my port open.
There was a fairly heavy sea. The water splashed
in and poured over my feet. I took off my boots
and went to sleep again in wet clothes. I woke
from a second douche. A third time I was splashed
over. I rose, and began to change my socks and
boots. I sat at the writing-table. Another wave
poured in, and literally wetted me from head to
foot.</p>

<p>Everything on the table was drenched. I had
to shut the port. Now it is so stuffy in my cabin
and the air is so steamy that I cannot breathe. I
am writing in the deck cabin. The weather is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
getting more and more rough. Perhaps it is for the
best&mdash;it will be more difficult for the enemy to
attack us.</p>

<p>By the morning we should be at Diego Garcia
(one of the islands of the Chagos Archipelago),
where the presence of Japanese ships is suspected.
In any case, I must be prepared to go to-morrow
morning to the <i>Gromky</i>, although the weather is
such that it will be difficult to coal. We are going
slowly. It is a good thing that a favourable current
is helping us on. During the last twenty-four hours
it has advanced us about fifty versts. This evening
all searchlights were lit up until the moon rose.</p>

<p><i>March 14th</i> (morning).&mdash;What a night it was!&mdash;so
stuffy and hot that when I woke not only were
the sheets and pillows wet, but the mat as well.</p>

<p>We had just done half the voyage between
Madagascar and the East Indian Archipelago. We
may count not only on torpedo-attacks and ground
mines, but also on a fleet action.</p>

<p>Our voyage to Vladivostok will be very dangerous.
We have to pass through straits and narrow
seas. All sorts of meetings and surprises are
possible. They will follow every movement of our
ships, choosing a favourable time to deliver battle
or make a torpedo-boat attack. Some one conceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the fancy that when the whole fleet coaled
in the open sea, and lay with engines stopped, a
Russian town had sprung up in the middle of the
ocean, with a population of 12,000 people. If I
reach Vladivostok, a distance which can be passed
over in fourteen or fifteen days will separate you
from me. How microscopic it will seem in comparison
with what we have already passed! It
will seem quite close to me.</p>

<p>If there are no delays anywhere, then by the
middle of April the fleet will reach Vladivostok.
But what is the use of guessing and calculating?&mdash;a
thousand things may yet happen.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that in the East Indian archipelago
there are so many straits which are long and
narrow. There are some which cannot be passed
through in a day, and have to be traversed at
night. They might be mined.</p>

<p>On entering or leaving them when the fleet is
spread out, torpedo attacks might be made. We
may expect surprises from torpedo-boats and from
the shores. It is impossible to pass through a strait
unperceived. I have just hit on the idea that we
may possibly go to Saigon. On the way to Saigon
a collison will infallibly take place. It may have
sad consequences for me as well as for the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps I shall not be able to send letters. Let
us suppose we get to Saigon. The <i>Diana</i> is lying
there. She is officially disarmed. What is to prevent
her joining our fleet? Instead of the <i>Diana</i> a
ship like the <i>Almez</i> might be left. That would be
excellent. It would be better if we were joined
by the <i>Cesarevitch</i>, <i>Askold</i>, and torpedo-boats. It
is difficult to count on this.</p>

<p>All the ships are disarmed in neutral ports. It
is a pity we have to pass through the straits in dark,
moonless nights.</p>

<p><i>March 15th.</i>&mdash;I was called at 5 a.m. in order to
go on board the <i>Gromky</i>.</p>

<p>Divers arrived and the work began. The work is
greatly hampered by the swell. The divers are
constantly struck by the rudder. I am astonished
at the dog's life they lead on board the torpedo-boats.
Whilst steaming, the vibration is so great
that it is impossible to write. They roll so much
that nothing remains on the tables without fiddles
(frames which support tumblers, plates, etc.). The
accommodation is cramped, and it is dirty and
sooty.</p>

<p>In addition to all this the fare is disgusting.
I remained in the <i>Gromky</i> until eleven o'clock. It
was time to eat, but they did not think of laying a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
table. They brought the crew their stchee,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and
my appetite left me. There were only four sausages
for the officers. Some officers from the <i>Kamchatka</i>,
which was lying close by, were in the <i>Gromky</i>. They
requested by semaphore that preserves, lemonade,
etc., might be sent from her. I was so hungry that
I did not hesitate to insist on their bringing sardines,
ham, bacon, etc. When they arrived we all threw
ourselves on these delicacies with avidity. They
purposely brought more than sufficient, in order to
leave the surplus for the officers of the torpedo-boat.
The latter astonished me. They look upon a
lack of food as inevitable. The <i>Irtish</i> should supply
them with provisions, but she fulfilled the duty
badly.</p>

<p>The captain asked that his torpedo-boat should
be attached to another transport. I supported the
captain's request to the utmost of my ability, and
depicted in vivid colours their famished condition.
Life on board a torpedo-boat is sufficiently penal,
but in this one they starve as well. For the future
the <i>Gromky</i> will be attached to the <i>Kieff</i>.</p>

<p>While I was in the <i>Gromky</i> a heavy squall went
by on the beam. It was lucky it did not catch the
torpedo-boat.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>
<p>Several times sharks gathered near the divers,
but they saw them in time and drove them away
with rifle-shots. You suddenly see a large, grey,
shapeless thing appearing. It is an ugly and
repulsive-looking shark.</p>

<p>In the <i>Gromky</i> I saw friend Grishka, "the
Iconoclast." This monkey has grown a great deal,
and is very amusing. I think I told you about
Grishka. He is the monkey who was the cause of
a scandal in the <i>Suvaroff</i>, and was given to another
ship. He received the nickname of the "Iconoclast,"
because he once stole an ikon out of the
cabin and threw it overboard.</p>

<p><i>March 16th</i> (evening).&mdash;Early this morning I again
went to the <i>Gromky</i>. I got there with difficulty.
The swell tossed the torpedo-boat all day. Heavy
rain-squalls constantly flew by. The boat rolled
more than 25°. Everything fell about. To sit you
had to press hands and feet against something.
How many times I was literally wet to the skin
to-day, and got dry again, it is difficult to say.
Under these conditions the divers had to work.
The waves now tore them from the boat, now beat
them against her, now retreating, showing the
diver's heads, now hiding them somewhere in the
abyss. They were rocked about under the water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and were seasick with all its consequences when in
diving clothes. They had to be drawn up, as they
were so faint. The work was desperately difficult.
I was astonished that they went into the water
again without refusing.</p>

<p>Picture to yourself the scene. All this was being
done in a torpedo-boat in the midst of the ocean.
The boat had been carried away from the fleet by
the swell; we could even no longer see it. The
diving-boat lay alongside the torpedo-boat. In
addition to this they were coaling at the same time.
It was a regular hell. The work went on very
slowly.</p>

<p>In order to review the results of my work I sat
on an outrigger (I have already told you what this
is) like a bird on a twig. When rolling, the water
now covered my head, now lifted me high. It was
horrible, abominable, foul. It was a good thing
there were no sharks.</p>

<p>At last, amid the chaos of waves and foam, I had
to go to the <i>Suvaroff</i> in a whaler. I seized hold of
a chain, pressed my feet against the side, and
climbed on deck. I was wet, dirty, and could
scarcely stand from fatigue. And what welcome
awaited me? A reprimand from the admiral, with
a cry of "Shameful! you serve on the staff, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
cover yourself with filth. You return at five o'clock,
instead of three." This is my reward! Never,
never shall I forget it! True, it is my first reprimand
during the seven months. What could I do?
They did not send a torpedo-boat for me, as they
always had done.</p>

<p>Nor was the <i>Gromky</i> at fault. She brought
me as soon as ever she could. When the work
was done she had to take the divers to the
<i>Svietlana</i>, <i>Kamchatka</i>, and <i>Jemchug</i>. I was only
guilty in that I was not guilty at all. Having
reached my cabin, I changed my clothes, and instantly
fell into a dead sleep.</p>

<p>There was nothing to eat in the <i>Gromky</i>, and she
could not receive anything from the transport.
They sent a present of a basket of provisions and a
live pig from the <i>Svietlana</i>. How pleased the
officers were!</p>

<p><i>March 17th</i> (morning).&mdash;Since last evening we
have been going along the equator.</p>

<p>We are a little to the north. How strange it
seems at first! Yesterday we were in the southern
half of the globe, where it was autumn; to-day we
are in the northern half, where it is spring. We
have missed a whole winter. There is news that
the <i>Varyag</i> has been raised by the Japanese.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Possibly they have already been able to repair
her, and we may meet her among the hostile ships.
A pleasant encounter! Our ships will fight against
us. What a disgrace!</p>

<p>The <i>Donskoi</i> reports that she sees occasional lights
out of funnels on the horizon. That they are
following us is beyond doubt. We shall go by
the straits of Malacca, the length of which is about
1,000 versts. There will be surprises on going
through it, and on leaving it we may count on
meeting the whole of Togo's fleet. Probably among
the Japanese ships will be those the Russians were
unable to sink properly at Port Arthur. I have
no confidence in success.</p>

<p>If I were in the place of the Japanese I should
let the whole fleet pass without hindrance to Vladivostok,
not risking my own ships in battle. It
would be so easy to make a second Port Arthur out
of it. A siege can be more easily undertaken there
(if they have not already done so). The fortress is
worse; there are less stores, workshops, and docks.</p>

<p>Every advantage is on Japan's side. Her success
is almost sure.</p>

<p><i>March 18th</i> (morning).&mdash;The weather is worse.
The barometer is falling. The wind gets stronger
and stronger; it has attained the force of a gale.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
The <i>Suvaroff</i> inclined three degrees to the wind, and
has remained in that position. My heart beats
when I think of the torpedo-boats. They are being
towed. I am very anxious about them. It will
be dark soon. How are they faring now? They
are not visible from the <i>Suvaroff</i>. The wind has
gone down, but the sea is still big. The <i>Bodry</i>, one
of the torpedo-boats, has her mast broken. The
<i>Gromky</i> broke her tow-rope, and is going independently.</p>

<p>During the last coaling a steam-cutter from the
<i>Sissoi</i> was sunk. All the crew were saved. The
boat incautiously approached the side of a battleship,
which rolled and sank her. In the <i>Terek</i>
yesterday a sailor fell into the hold, and died to-day.</p>

<p><i>March 19th</i> (morning).&mdash;Probably the whole
world thought the fleet would go from Nosi Be to
the East, round Australia or the straits of Sunda.
It is proposed to go, as I have said, by the straits
of Malacca. Every one will be astonished at our
effrontery.</p>

<p>In a day or so we shall enter on a route where
there are many merchant steamers. This means
that in a short time all the world will know the
whereabouts of our fleet and the route chosen.</p>

<p>At a favourable spot the Japanese may meet us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
The impending battle will be one of the most
momentous of the war.</p>

<p>Important events will soon now begin to take
place. A new phase of the war which has been so
unsuccessful and unfortunate for us is beginning.</p>

<p>We are not going to Saigon, but to Kamranh.
It is a small bay, lying about 350 versts north of
Saigon. On shore there is a fort and a small settlement.
There is no telegraph, but apparently there
is a post-office. The fleet will pass in view of
Singapore.</p>

<p>Many officers have begun to hide their things
behind the armour, in order to be able to dress themselves
after the battle. I do not know whether to
hide anything. We have begun to feel the proximity
of the enemy. I have not yet selected the
place where I shall be during the fight. Of course,
during torpedo attacks one should be on deck, so
that, should the ship be blown up and begin to sink,
one would not have to come up from below. A
ship in this event may go down almost instantaneously,
like the <i>Petropavlosk</i> and the <i>Hatsuse</i>.</p>

<p><i>March 20th</i> (morning).&mdash;Coaling has not taken
place to-day. Many officers confidently rely on the
fleet. They look on the four new battleships,
<i>Suvaroff</i>, <i>Borodino</i>, <i>Alexander</i>, and <i>Orel</i>, as invincible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
The Japanese will put forth all their power to
destroy the <i>Suvaroff</i>, in which is the admiral commanding
the whole fleet. The torpedo attacks and
the fire of all guns will be concentrated on the
<i>Suvaroff</i>. She will be exposed to the greatest
danger. It will be less dangerous in the other
ships, especially in the <i>Borodino</i> and <i>Orel</i>.</p>

<p>The Japanese will try to kill the admiral. And
what will happen then? Our ships can scarcely
fly to various neutral ports and be disarmed, as
has been done before.</p>

<p>We have been eighteen days at sea, and our port
is still far away; but with each turn of the screw
we are nearer and nearer our goal. It is five and
a half months to-day since the fleet left Libau.
Scarcely any one would have supposed that nearly
six months would be necessary to get as far as the
straits of Malacca.</p>

<p>The <i>Donskoi</i>, <i>Oleg</i>, <i>Orel</i>, and <i>Terek</i> report that
they have seen lights. Hitherto the appearance of
every light interested us; but now that we are
near the theatre of war we regard them with
complete equanimity. Is it not all the same?
Would that it were sooner ended! There are people
who are satisfied with the existing state of affairs.</p>

<p>I am surprised at them. Just now there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
officers sitting at table drunk&mdash;they are singing.
Nothing like it is possible in the Japanese ships.
There, they are preparing for another feast and for
other songs. When shall we get our letters?
Hardly before we reach Kamranh Bay.</p>

<p><i>March 21st.</i>&mdash;There still remains 3,000 versts to
Kamranh Bay. They say that Japanese cruisers
are waiting for us there. It will be ten or twelve
days' journey if nothing happens. From there to
Vladivostok I think we shall go at greater speed
than now, to get over 5,000 versts. They are coaling
to-day.</p>

<p>I went to the <i>Bezuprechny</i> and <i>Gromky</i> and
distributed confidential packets to the ships.
Of course, I did not go to the general lunch. I
lunched instead with the officer of the watch. A
curious thing happened in the <i>Bezuprechny</i>. They
drew a small shark out of the Kingstons. It was
drawn in by the current. The ships are now forming
in battle order. Probably lunch will be late. To-morrow
is the new moon. It will give little light
at night. It is a pity that we shall have to pass
through the straits of Malacca on a dark night,
when we may expect the Japanese to destroy our
ships in the narrows.</p>

<p><i>March 22nd.</i>&mdash;Although I did not feel tired yesterday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
I lay down and slept till the waves splashed
in through the port and woke me.</p>

<p>Three sailors were scalded by steam in the
<i>Oslyabya</i>; it is not yet known if they are seriously
hurt. I have discovered the reason of my sleepiness
yesterday. I began to smoke new French cigarettes.
They had opium in them. It is a pity I
have only a hundred cigarettes left. They are
very dear now. I must smoke others, and keep
those with opium in reserve.</p>

<p>The torpedo-boat <i>Buiny</i> has damaged her forward
torpedo-tube by striking the <i>Vladimir</i>. Now it
will not work.</p>

<p>The fleet will pass through the straits of Malacca
in four columns. All the transports will be in the
middle, the battleships on the extreme right, and
the cruisers on the extreme left.</p>

<p>It is curious. You would expect us to be alarmed.
We are almost on the eve of meeting with the enemy's
fleet, with his mines, submarine boats, and torpedo-boats,
and yet I am quite calm, even happy. The
prospect of being at Vladivostok in a month's time is so
exhilarating. I daily look at the chart with feverish
interest, where the course already run is shown,
and I count the remaining miles to Vladivostok.</p>

<p>Are they despairing in Russia and not counting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
on Vladivostok being able to hold out? If on our
arrival at Kamranh we learn that it has fallen, we
should then have no base. What could we do then?
We should have to occupy one of the Japanese
islands and make it our base&mdash;but that would be
bad for the supply of warlike provisions, ammunition,
correspondence, and telegrams. They would
not allow a base to be made at a neutral port. There
is a report that the Japanese have made themselves
at home in the islands of the Natuna Archipelago,
which nominally belong to Holland. These islands
lie on our course higher up, north of the strait of
Singapore, which is a continuation of Malacca.</p>

<p>How quickly rats swim! Two were thrown overboard
to-day. They chased the ship and climbed up,
although the speed was nearly seven knots.</p>

<p>Up to the present the newspapers have not known
where the fleet is to be found. To-morrow we shall
pass by the lighthouse of Pulo Way. From there
the ends of the earth will be informed by telegrams.</p>

<p>Strange lights have appeared. Our fleet has been
ordered to put out superfluous lights. Ports are
covered with dead lights. We may expect an attack
to-night. At last our wartime has begun.</p>

<p>How many restless nights are before us? How
will it all end?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

THROUGH THE STRAITS OF MALACCA</h2>


<p><i>March 23rd</i> (morning).&mdash;Yesterday the following
message was received from the captain of the <i>Terek</i>:
"The crew will not disperse after prayers, and
demand that the first lieutenant should be changed.
The latter requests to be taken off the ship's books.
I consider the crew in the wrong." What? A
mutiny? The last sentence is specially characteristic.</p>

<p>The fleet has increased speed. We are entering
the straits of Malacca, and have said good-bye to
the Indian Ocean. Two oceans successfully passed!
What will the third bring us? The island of Pulo
Way is close, but not yet visible.</p>

<p>During the day the shores of a small island were
to be seen on the horizon, lying off the island of
Sumatra. This is the first land which we have
seen since leaving Nosi Be. For twenty days we
have seen no land at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>It is difficult to remain in one's cabin, owing to
the heat. No other place is convenient for writing.</p>

<p>The ship is in darkness everywhere. This has
been done purposely, in order that when the men
have to rush hurriedly on deck they will be accustomed
to the darkness. The battleship <i>Orel</i>
delayed the speed of the fleet for two hours. One
of her principal steam-pipes burst, and she could
not steam. Now it is repaired. We are at present
in a wide part of the straits. God forbid that a
similar thing should happen in the narrows, or
during the battle.</p>

<p>Since seven o'clock till the present moment I
have been on the bridge, hesitating to go below.
Nevertheless, I am satisfied&mdash;satisfied because we
are moving towards the finale.</p>

<p><i>March 24th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday we lost four hours of the
twenty-four. This is bad. In order to pass through
the dangerous parts by day we shall have to remain
in the straits an extra day. The sooner we pass the
straits of Malacca and Singapore the better.</p>

<p>I am surprised at myself. I am in no way disturbed.
Knowing that at any moment any night
we may be attacked, I continue to sleep peacefully.
I go to bed undressed. I go to sleep quickly, and
think little about the danger. My servant is dissatisfied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
He bothers me to hide my things. He has
not found a convenient place for them, and it troubles
him. Though I know of a good place, I am silent.
He is probably beginning a removal. I shall have
to sort out my clothes, and I do not want to.</p>

<p>It is raining and gloomy.</p>

<p>This morning there were two water-spouts, but I
did not see them, although I got up at seven.</p>

<p>The torpedo-boat <i>Biedovy</i> reported that in the
morning a sailor was found lying motionless on
deck. It was concluded that he was dead. They
asked permission to bury him at once. The staff
delayed the answer. Suddenly it was discovered
that he was alive. A nice thing if they had thrown
him alive into the sea!</p>

<p>One of the officers in the <i>Suvaroff</i> was playing
with the dog yesterday. The dog grew very tired,
and suddenly began to bark furiously, rushed on
deck, and bit the other dogs. They poured water
over it, but to no purpose. It jumped into the
stern gallery, and then overboard, and was drowned.
The two dogs which were bitten were tied up, as
they may possibly go mad.</p>

<p>We have been some time in the straits of Malacca,
but up to the present have not met a single steamer.
At night sometimes lights are visible, and once by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
day smoke was seen on the horizon. It was hardly
perceptible. Before the storm there is calm. It
may be so now. A signal has been made that at
night officers are not to sleep away from the guns
they command. The crew have been sleeping at
their guns for some time past. Every precaution
is taken against a night attack of torpedo-boats.</p>

<p>We have begun to meet several steamers. They
very wisely get out of their way in good time.</p>

<p>A heavy squall has just gone by. Until then the
sea was as calm as a mirror.</p>

<p>The officers are distributing pots with powders
for extinguishing fires, and bags containing bandages.
I do not believe in fire-extinguishing powders.</p>

<p>The sailor about whose death there was a misunderstanding
has been buried. Some one in the
torpedo-boat read the appointed prayers, our priest
with his cross blessed the deceased from afar,
and the body was launched into the sea. How
simple!</p>

<p>After dinner I spent three hours on the bridge
with the captain. I had tea there. I asked him
about Vladivostok and the life there, etc.</p>

<p>At noon to-day there were 2,100 more versts to
Kamranh, which we can do in about seven days
if there is no fight or other hindrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p><i>March 25th</i> (day).&mdash;We met steamers all night,
but they went aside out of our course.</p>

<p>The Hull incident has had its advantages. Last
night we met several steamers. The searchlights were
turned on them.</p>

<p>Admiral Enquist states that he, the captain,
officers, and crew clearly saw a steamer, behind
which twelve torpedo-boats were following. This
can hardly be true. The Japanese are not so foolish
as to show their torpedo-boats by day to an enemy's
fleet. The <i>Isumrud</i> reported that she saw a steamer
followed by porpoises. She hesitates to say that
they are submarines, but thinks they are.</p>

<p>We shall soon be in a very narrow part, where
the fairway is far from wide. We are obliged to
go by this fairway, as it is not possible to avoid it.
Something horrible may happen in it. There may
be submarine boats, or ground-mines, which they
may place shortly before we pass, in order that
other ships should not strike them. Mines can be
put down so that at a given time they will sink
themselves. The steamer that is shadowing us
might easily do this. She is behaving suspiciously&mdash;now
going fast, now stopping, now altering
course. What is to prevent her from going on
ahead, and laying down ground-mines in her wake?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Even if our ships successfully evade the mines, they
will in a certain period of time sink, and the straits
will again be safe for neutral ships. It can all be
done so simply and conveniently. Will the Japanese
really allow such an opportunity to pass of damaging
our fleet?</p>

<p>To-day there was mass. I did not go to church,
but lay down. I wanted to go to sleep.</p>

<p>Another night, and the straits of Malacca will be
behind us. The night is dark. At 4 a.m. we shall
again be in a narrow fairway. We shall pass
Singapore by day, and at six we shall enter the
South China Sea. We shall pass the Natuna Islands,
where the presence of the Japanese is suspected.</p>

<p>Do they intend to attack us in the straits of
Malacca? By to-morrow evening this will be
cleared up. Will they concentrate all their attention
and their strength on the strait of Sunda, or east
of it? Perhaps they do not want to undertake
anything till the fleet enters the China Sea. The
Japanese are enterprising. Why do they miss
opportunities that are so favourable for them?</p>

<p>To-day we saw a long, narrow, even strip of land
which was the Malay Peninsula. It is here that
I again see the Asiatic Continent.</p>

<p>Some strange birds were flying round the ships.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
They were not gulls, nor albatrosses, or any other
sea-bird.</p>

<p><i>March 26th</i> (night).&mdash;At eleven o'clock we passed
the town of Malacca. The lights of the town were
distinctly visible. Of course, the lights of our ships
are clearly seen in the town. When we were passing
it a schooner appeared on the horizon, coming
towards us. The searchlights were turned on to
her. A torpedo-boat approached her, and conducted
her past the fleet. It was a pretty sight.
Her white hull and sails showed out clearly in the
darkness. She passed close to the right column
of battleships.</p>

<p>None of the officers has gone to bed to-night.
I am thinking of going now. It might happen that
we shall reach Vladivostok without meeting Japanese
ships. It would be a great surprise for us all.
The sea is wide, and there are many ways to that
port. It is possible that our extreme course will
be so successfully chosen that the Japanese will
leave it unwatched.</p>

<p>Since the battle of Mukden we have had no news
of what is going on at the theatre of war. As a
matter of fact, we only had agency telegrams about
the Mukden fight. Many people doubt their authenticity.
I believe them. Up to the present all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the French agency telegrams have informed us of
has proved true.</p>

<p>In a few hours we shall be in the China Sea.</p>

<p>The officers are enumerating various reasons why
the Japanese did nothing while we were in the
straits of Malacca. Perhaps they have prepared
for a meeting in the Rio Strait, which we shall soon
pass. Perhaps the English insisted on their not
causing trouble by laying mines in the straits of
Malacca, where there are considerable movements
of merchant ships. Perhaps the Japanese fleet is
waiting for us at the Natuna Archipelago. Fighting
a battle there would be more advantageous for us,
because our ships could man&oelig;uvre.</p>

<p>We shall see if anything happens to-night. Some
people suppose that peace may have concluded.
If that is the case, it is a very disgraceful peace.
Russia can scarcely entertain it.</p>

<p>I did not leave my cabin until six o'clock to-day.
Going on deck, I learnt the news that the Russian
consul from Singapore approached the fleet in a
tug, and told us that three weeks ago the Japanese
fleet at its full strength came to Singapore, accompanied
by twelve transports, floating workshops,
hospitals, and torpedo-boats. From Singapore they
went to Borneo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Near Borneo is the small island of Labuan. The
Japanese bought land from a Russian Jew, in this
island, and made themselves at home there. They
connected Labuan with Singapore by a telegraph-cable.
By this means they could have received
news of our movements yesterday. Their fleet at
Labuan consists of twenty-two warships, not counting
transports, hospital-ships, workshops, and
torpedo-boats.</p>

<p>To-night a torpedo attack, and to-morrow a
battle, are almost inevitable. I must put on clean
clothes, and lay in a stock of wool so as not to be
deafened by the firing.</p>

<p>I received an extract from the log. Such
nonsense is written in it that I shall have to
alter it.</p>

<p>It is past ten o'clock, and up to now all is quiet.
The Japanese consider the 27th their lucky
number. Perhaps they have postponed the battle
to that date.</p>

<p>According to the consul the passage of our fleet
through the straits of Malacca was a complete
surprise to every one, including the Japanese.
That accounts for our not having met with any
resistance. The eyes of all were fixed in another
direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Another ship has just met and passed the fleet.
We turned searchlights on her and let her pass.
At noon to-day we were about 1,500 versts from
Kamranh. If there are no delays we can get there
on March 30th.</p>

<p>Probably in this evening's telegrams is the news
that our fleet has passed Singapore. We heard
that Vladivostok and Harbin are still in our hands.
Shall I go to bed, and if so shall I sleep? What
if there is an attack? I have begun to look with
equanimity on possible attacks and fights.</p>

<p>I do not think I shall lose my presence of mind
during a battle, but shall remain calm. Soon I
may put myself to the test.</p>

<p>Again the attention of the whole world is concentrated
on the fleet. How much the war depends
on its success or defeat! The hope of victory is
small, but if it comes, everything will be changed
at once. The faces of a good many lengthened a
little when the proximity of the Japanese fleet
was known. A conflict with it is unavoidable.</p>

<p><i>March 27th.</i>&mdash;The night passed quietly. The
fleet has stopped since this morning. Torpedo-boats
are coaling. They had very little left, and
it would not last to Kamranh. What of the Japanese?
Do they not know the place where we are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
be found, and are they looking for us at sea? It
is hardly likely.</p>

<p>Our course is clear&mdash;to the north from Singapore
to Vladivostok. Perhaps they have gone ahead
and are waiting somewhere. This is possible.</p>

<p>The question is being asked why the fleet does
not go straight to Vladivostok, not calling at Kamranh.
It would be easy to do this if the ships were
filled up with coal for so great a distance. Coaling
at sea when an attack is expected every minute is
unwise and dangerous.</p>

<p>The torpedo-boats have filled up with coal and
the fleet is proceeding. To-day there was mass.
I stood thinking that perhaps this was the last service
in the <i>Suvaroff</i>. Perhaps the next will be a
requiem for the killed. We must expect and be
prepared for everything.</p>

<p>7 p.m.&mdash;We have passed the island of Anamba.
The admiral opines that we shall meet the Japanese
fleet to-morrow. The sea is calm. There is a
swell. The small ships roll. It is interesting to
know what impression the news, that the fleet has
passed Singapore, will produce in Petersburg.
Where is the third fleet now? Will it join us at
Vladivostok? Shall we await it at Kamranh?
If we safely arrive at that bay, then the Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
will have to look after the Vladivostok cruisers,
our ships, and the third fleet. They will have to
divide their forces, and that would be an advantage
for us. Can they not have left ships to watch
Vladivostok? Is there ice there still? They say
it usually breaks up at the beginning of April.</p>

<p>During the coming fight the <i>Oleg</i> and <i>Aurora</i>
have been ordered to support the battleships that
are sustaining the fight. Some of the cruisers will
remain to defend the transports, which ought to
try and reach Kamranh.</p>

<p>At noon to-day we were rather more than 1,000
versts from it, and relatively closer to our final
goal. Can it be that at the very last we shall be
unsuccessful? All our troubles and deprivations
will have been in vain. There are too many chances
on the side of Japan. It is a good thing that we
passed through the straits of Malacca. The Japanese
evidently did not count on our taking such a
risky step. The papers, continually writing about
the strait of Sunda and our colliers which were
assembled there, turned their attention from the
straits of Malacca. The consul, however, stated
that five submarines were waiting for us the way
we came. If that was the case, why did they not
attack?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p><i>March 28th.</i>&mdash;All is quiet at present. Where
are the Japanese? Why have they not attacked
us? Perhaps they thought they might disable some
of our ships with torpedos in the strait of Sunda.
The large ships would then attack our weakened
fleet to decisively destroy it. The whole scheme
was upset as we did not go that way. Perhaps
they are now cruising somewhere near Saigon awaiting
us. Our idea is to go in to Kamranh, and wait
there for the third fleet and those ships which
leave Russia in the spring with the <i>Slava</i> at their
head.</p>

<p>We shall lie at Kamranh an endless number of
days in inactivity, as we did at Nosi Be. We have
already been twenty-six days at sea. Provisions
are running short. We have taken to salt meat.
At the admiral's table there is neither vodky, meat,
nor coffee.</p>

<p>Following the general fashion, I intended to hide
my things. I looked at my winter forage-cap and
there it ended. I am lazy.</p>

<p>Our fleet has made an unusual voyage. If it
succeeded in reaching Vladivostok without calling
at Kamranh, the whole world would be amazed
at the immensity and daring of the voyage.</p>

<p>10 p.m.&mdash;We have begun to receive telegraphic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
signs. Possibly the Japanese cruisers are communicating
with each other, seeking us.</p>

<p>Perhaps we shall not go to Kamranh after all.
Colliers are due to arrive there on April 1st. We
shall then receive our mails. This letter must be
closed in good time. By my reckoning you will
receive it at the end of April. By that time my
fate and the fate of the fleet will be made clear.</p>

<p><i>March 29th.</i>&mdash;<i>South China Sea.</i></p>

<p>I sent a letter and telegram to you by the
hospital-ship <i>Orel</i>, which is going to Saigon. She
will be near there by dawn, if the Japanese have
not attacked by that time. Then she will be
obliged to take their sick and wounded, and
receive orders from them. They will not sink her,
as she is a Red Cross hospital. The <i>Suvaroff</i> alone
managed to send letters. The other ships did not
even know that she was going to Saigon to-day.
An invalid officer was sent on board the <i>Orel</i>.
He could not walk on board, but was hoisted up
by a derrick in a special chair. A little coffee
was obtained from the <i>Orel</i> for the admiral's table.</p>

<p>I overslept myself to-day, and only arose at nine
o'clock.</p>

<p>It is a time of alarms. We constantly meet
various steamers, principally under the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
flag. The <i>Oleg</i> continually approaches to question
them. This morning we met two English cruisers.
One of them saluted, and the <i>Suvaroff</i> answered.</p>

<p>This was early. I woke up, hearing the firing.
"Now," I thought, "they have begun." I looked
out of my port and went to sleep again. When
our signalmen first saw the English cruisers, they
decided it was the <i>Diana</i> coming to join us. One
of them was rather like her. Perhaps the English
cruisers help the Japanese to look after our fleet.
We saw seven clouds of smoke, but they quickly
disappeared behind the horizon. They were evidently
seven ships. A steamer flying the English
flag met a detachment of our cruisers scouting,
and signalled, "Have seen Japanese torpedo-boats.
Beware, and look out for attacks to-night."</p>

<p>I am pleased that I was able to send you a letter
and telegram. I do not count on receiving an
answer to the latter.</p>

<p>The <i>Orel</i> will not stay long at Saigon. Probably
you will receive my last letter in April, or in the
beginning of May, when we shall be at Vladivostok,
or&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>March 30th.</i>&mdash;General coaling has been going on
from early this morning. If we had continued our
voyage we should have been at Kamranh about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
two o'clock. Now we cannot get there before
to-morrow.</p>

<p>There is no communication between the ships.
There is a great scandal in the <i>Alexander III.</i> She
indicated that she had about 900 tons of coal, but
in reality it proved to be only 350.</p>

<p>Gradually everything is coming to an end. Cigarettes
and matches are scarce. I obtained a piece
of soap to-day, and there is only one left.</p>

<p>When the coaling finished, the fleet proceeded.
I did not leave the <i>Suvaroff</i>. Several times in the
course of the day merchant vessels passed the fleet.
I make out that we shall reach Kamranh by dawn
to-morrow. We shall anchor there later.</p>

<p>The depth of the fairway will be sounded and
searched. Although the soundings of this bay are
shown on the chart, they do not trust them entirely.
The search will be for fear that the Japanese have
laid down mines. It will not be an unnecessary
precaution. The bay has two entrances. At one of
these a temporary boom will be made in order that
the Japanese may not creep up to our ships that way.</p>

<p>10 p.m.&mdash;A sailor was buried at sea to-day. It
is an extraordinary thing that it again happened
in the <i>Oslyabya</i>. They have a great many deaths
in that ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>The charts with the soundings of Kamranh
proved very inaccurate. One officer informed the
staff that he had grounded there in some ship. The
depth of the spot was shown in the chart as great,
whereas in fact it was slight.</p>

<p>While they are sounding and searching to-morrow
all the ships will coal, in order not to waste
time.</p>

<p>Birds are flying round the ships. A heron and
a dove fell from weariness near the <i>Suvaroff</i>. The
heron was drowned, but the dove was rescued by
a cutter loaded with coal.</p>

<p>The moon is now shining. In half an hour it
will have set and darkness will come on. If the
Japanese do not take advantage of it for a night
attack, we shall be near Kamranh by morning. I
am pleased. As a matter of fact, I was thrown out
of my groove the moment the war began. At first
there was heavy night work, I was seldom at home;
then I was transferred to Cronstadt, then Revel,
and Libau, and then abroad. I have had fourteen
months of this unnatural and vagrant life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

THE STAY AT KAMRANH</h2>


<p><i>March 31st.</i>&mdash;Arrived at Kamranh. We are lying
with engines stopped.</p>

<p>Steamboats and torpedo-boats have gone to
reconnoitre and take soundings. Coaling is just
beginning. As we approached this morning there
was a fog. Suddenly it lifted, and between the
fleet and the shore a steamer was seen. Seeing the
fleet, she went full speed, hoping to escape. The
<i>Jemchug</i>, <i>Isumrud</i>, and <i>Svietlana</i> were sent to
examine her. They overtook her, questioned her,
and let her go without examination.</p>

<p>How many steamers were allowed to go in this
way! I am firmly convinced that many of them
were carrying goods and provisions to Japan.
We allowed them to go after merely questioning
them, and not even setting foot on their decks.
What sort of a fool would admit that he was taking
a cargo to Japan? Steamers should be searched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and not questioned. We have let this one go.
Why did she run if there was nothing contraband
on board?</p>

<p>The Japanese would have acted differently. They
would not have parted from them with answers
only. Everything drops into our hands, and we
neglect it. How the Japanese and their friends
must jeer at us! And they are right.</p>

<p>It is hot here. At Vladivostok it is cold. When
we arrive there the sharp change of temperature
will hardly be conducive to health. There will
probably be much catarrh, and even here at Kamranh
it is easy to go down with the local fever. A
cold wind comes from the hills.</p>

<p>The colliers should arrive soon, bringing the old
mails. I count on receiving letters from December
13th to January 21st.</p>

<p>Where has that respected institution called the
Naval General Staff sent our letters now? Probably
they are pigeon-holed in Petersburg. We
have not yet entered the bay, but are lying near it.
In the depths of my heart flutters a hope that the
<i>Orel</i> brings your answering telegram. The last
one was a month and half ago.</p>

<p>We shall evidently receive nothing from Kamranh,
neither provisions nor stores. It is beginning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
be doubtful if we shall be able to send a mail. It
is supposed that our stay here will not be long.
We shall take in coal and stores, and move on.</p>

<p>The distance from here to Vladivostok as the
crow flies, <i>i.e.</i> in a straight line, is little more than
3,000 versts. Of course, our journey will be considerably
longer. I reckon that if nothing happens
we can do it in fifteen days. Trying days they
will be. Perhaps the course we choose will be
round about, in which case we shall toss on the sea
a long time.</p>

<p>11 p.m.&mdash;The transports and some of the torpedo-boats
have entered the bay; the other torpedo-boats
and warships will remain at sea, cruising round
Kamranh with lights. Probably we shall go into
the bay to-morrow. There are signs that we shall
wait here for the third fleet. If you could but
imagine what is going on! If it were possible for
me to tell you all about it, you would be amazed.
Should I live, I will tell you afterwards. No, there
is no use our fighting. Things have come to such
a pass that I can only wring my hands and feel
assured that no one can escape his fate, for this is
the only possible assurance.</p>

<p>The weather has begun to grow cooler. The
engines and boilers of all the ships are worn, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the boilers. It is not surprising, considering
that for thirty days we have not let go an anchor.
Everything has its limits.</p>

<p><i>April 1st.</i>&mdash;Kamranh Bay. We have only just
begun to enter the bay, having spent thirty days
at sea.</p>

<p>The hospital-ship <i>Orel</i> has not returned, nor have
the colliers come. Have they fallen into the hands
of the Japanese?</p>

<p>When our warships approached close to Kamranh,
fishermen were seen in their boats; but for some
reason not one of them came near us.</p>

<p>In the morning a little bird, apparently an exhausted
canary, was caught on deck.</p>

<p>Last night was cooler. I woke up dry this
morning. Such a thing has not happened to me
for a very long time.</p>

<p>One cannot help wondering if it is wise, losing
so much time at Kamranh. All the preparations
Japan made for meeting us at the Sunda Straits
can be transferred to another spot. They will have
time to construct everything afresh. Their device
at Sunda Strait having failed, it will be more advantageous
for them to meet our fleet nearer their
own shores, where they could at once repair their
damages and where they have many bases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>All this compels me to think that we are hardly
likely to meet them before passing Formosa. Of
course, if we remain long at this place, circumstances
may alter, and afford the Japanese the possibility
of attacking us in the bay itself, and of mining it.
In that case Kamranh will be an actual trap. It
seems to me that the Japanese consider us more
crafty than we really are. On the contrary, we are
very simple. I say "simple" in order not to use
a stronger term.</p>

<p>We have just anchored. The approaching colliers
can be seen in the distance. The shores of the bay
are hilly, in some places covered with growth; in
others there is grey stone or sand. The sand is a
curious colour; sometimes it is quite white, and
sometimes yellow.</p>

<p>I have to go away in the steamboat. During
the night, two torpedo-boats went to examine a
passing steamer, and the <i>Blestyastchy</i> managed to
tear the <i>Bezuprechny's</i> side. The sea is not wide
enough for two Russian torpedo-boats! They
must be repaired. In the <i>Bezuprechny</i> the
rudder is out of order, and one engine does not
work.</p>

<p>Officers who went into the bay in torpedo-boats
yesterday state that at Kamranh there are post<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
and telegraph offices, plenty of provisions, and that
a railway is being constructed to Saigon.</p>

<p>A telegram was received here yesterday that the
third fleet had left Jibutil. Hava's agency states
that a great fight occurred between our fleet and
the Japanese, near the island of Borneo. Such
false news will only cause uneasiness in Russia.</p>

<p>Three weeks ago two Japanese cruisers arrived
here, but two torpedo-boats were sent from Saigon
demanding them to leave the bay. They went.
Perhaps they will tell us to go away from here, and
evidently it is supposed that we shall remain here
a long time.</p>

<p>The external appearance of the bay and its
entrances compare with Port Arthur. I hope it
will not actually become a second Port Arthur.</p>

<p>They are just bringing the mail from the collier.</p>

<p><i>April 2nd.</i>&mdash;Yesterday the admirals and captains
of all ships were sent for on board the <i>Suvaroff</i>.
There was a council of war.</p>

<p>The collier only brought from Diego Suarez
letters which were addressed to Madagascar. For
some ships there were no letters, and for others
only two or three each. There was much swearing
over it.</p>

<p>The hospital-ship <i>Orel</i> is approaching and brings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
news. Yesterday about 3 p.m. I went to the
<i>Bezuprechny</i>. The work there seemed enormous.
They wanted a fortnight to do it in. I undertook
to do it in forty-eight hours, and I think I shall
succeed. I went to bed at four&mdash;slept in the <i>Kamchatka</i>
in the captain's deck cabin. I made myself
very dirty. In the torpedo-boats I always take
care to wear some one else's white tunic when I
have to crawl about.</p>

<p>I fed in the <i>Kamchatka</i>. They feed there better
than in the <i>Suvaroff</i>. A Chinese cook has been
engaged from Singapore for the admiral's table;
perhaps the <i>Orel</i> is bringing him here.</p>

<p>The workmen in the <i>Kamchatka</i> are without
tobacco, and pay ten copecks for a cigarette. How
is this? Tobacco was sent them from the <i>Suvaroff</i>.
I got on board with difficulty, as there was no boat.</p>

<p>At sunset I shall go to the torpedo-boat, and
spend the night there. They sent off a mail while
I was away. I was sorry I could not send a letter.
When I leave the <i>Suvaroff</i> again I shall leave this
one, and hope that it will be sent somehow.</p>

<p>How carelessly they deal with the post! It was
decided that the <i>Gortchakoff</i> (transport) should go
to Russia from Nosi Be. They sent the mail in
her and many sailors' letters. The <i>Gortchakoff</i> came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
with us, all the correspondence is in her, and the
senders think that the letters have already been
received at home. It is very annoying. Several
letters contained money.</p>

<p>The <i>Orel</i> took the invalid officer to Saigon, in
order that he might go back to Russia.</p>

<p>When we were passing through the straits of
Malacca a sailor of the <i>Alexander</i> disappeared, with
his hammock. They thought he wanted to desert
the ship, and had thrown himself overboard, taking
with him his hammock, which was covered with
cork and floats. When the <i>Bezuprechny</i> received
her injury a servant thought she was sinking, and
waking all the officers, he put a life-belt into their
hands.</p>

<p>There is a goat in that torpedo-boat. They
brought her from Nosi Be. During the thirty days'
passage she fed only on paper, did not eat hay,
and even now refuses it. They nurse her like a
baby. All the visiting-cards have been eaten by
her. To-day she has been taken for a run on
shore.</p>

<p>A boatswain and a sailor were buried to-day.
They were killed by a derrick in the <i>Irtish</i>. In almost
every port there are victims of accidents in the
fleet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>I saw some natives&mdash;Annamese. They are of
the Malay type, yellow and rather repulsive. They
approached the <i>Kamchatka</i> and <i>Bezuprechny</i>, offering
to sell various rubbish. The tobacco was
quickly bought up, and they paid very dearly
for it.</p>

<p>Will the <i>Orel</i> bring me an answer to my telegram?
How delighted I should be if I received it!</p>

<p>We are coaling in the <i>Suvaroff</i>. Everywhere
there is dirt and nastiness; they are heaping up
coal in the wardroom and in the officers' cabins.</p>

<p>1 a.m.&mdash;Received your telegram. Many thanks.</p>

<p><i>April 3rd.</i>&mdash;<i>Transport Kamchatka, Kamranh Bay.</i></p>

<p>At last I can write. I have not been in the
<i>Suvaroff</i> since yesterday. All the time I was either
in the <i>Bezuprechny</i> or on board the <i>Kamchatka</i>,
where I am now writing to you. I obtained paper,
went into the deck-house, and am scribbling. Horrible!
Whole flocks of cockroaches are running
about.</p>

<p>The German steamer <i>Dagmar</i> weighed anchor
yesterday to go to Saigon. She was stopped and
given a mail from the staff. I took advantage of
this, and gave my letters to be sent to her.</p>

<p>I am not satisfied with the work in the <i>Bezuprechny</i>.
I counted on finishing it to-day, and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
not succeeded. The sea and the swell hindered it.
Her rudder is repaired, and they are now repairing
the breach.</p>

<p>Yesterday a French cruiser came to Kamranh
with an admiral. Salutes were exchanged. The
admirals paid each other visits. To-day the cruiser
left.</p>

<p>11 p.m.&mdash;Battleship <i>Kniaz Suvaroff</i>.</p>

<p>I had scarcely succeeded in writing the last page
when a letter from the <i>Suvaroff</i> came for me. I
found the ship horribly dirty. Everywhere there
was coal-dust as thick as your finger. It hangs in
the air like a fog. I do not know where or how to
sleep. It is hot and dusty in the cabin. Last
night I dozed, sitting on the <i>Kamchatka's</i> deck in
a chair (a canvas one like those used in datchas<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>).
I woke up at six o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>These last days I have been feeding in the
<i>Bezuprechny</i>, or sometimes in the <i>Kamchatka</i>. They
feed better everywhere than in the <i>Suvaroff</i>. It has
been awkward about provisions up to now. Everything
has been bought up on shore. Literally
nothing remains. Eggs are sold at twenty-eight
copecks a-piece (about 7<i>d.</i>). In the morning they
were selling ox-meat for nearly a gold piece.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>
<p>Altogether there are four Europeans living on
shore, and forty Malays. It is almost a desert.
There are only five or six houses. The engineers
who are constructing the railway live on the opposite
side of the bay.</p>

<p>There is a telegraph and post-office here. A
Chinese receives the correspondence, and does it
very slowly. From twelve to six yesterday he only
took ten telegrams and twelve letters from two
men. Twelve men were unable to hand in anything.
A Chinese clerk is not a quick worker.</p>

<p>There is splendid sport here&mdash;elephants, tigers,
monkeys, etc.</p>

<p>A clerk from the <i>Donskoi</i> was buried on shore
to-day. Admiral Folkersham has had a stroke,
but the doctors say it is very slight and not
dangerous. Do you remember I told you a sailor
threw himself and his hammock into the straits of
Malacca? A steamer picked him up, took him to
Singapore, handed him over to the Russian consul,
who sent him to Saigon, and from there he was
sent to the fleet. He declares that he fell overboard
accidentally.</p>

<p>When the hospital-ship <i>Orel</i> approached Saigon
she was met by a cutter and a steamer of Günsburg's,
which had come to co-operate with her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
The public were not allowed on board the <i>Orel</i>.
In the evening, papers came out announcing that
the Japanese had been defeated by our fleet, that
the <i>Orel</i> was full of wounded, whose groans were
audible, although no one was allowed on board, etc.
Such lies can only agitate people in Russia. The
Japanese, of whom there are many in Saigon, were
so offended that next day they did not leave their
houses.</p>

<p>I was afraid I should not have been able to write
to you to-day. It would have been the first time.
Even on the day of the storm off the Cape of Good
Hope, on December 8th, I managed to write a few
words.</p>

<p><i>April 4th.</i>&mdash;It was arranged by signal that all
engineer-constructors should assemble to meet me.
After having spoken to them, I set out for the
<i>Nachimoff</i>. I lunched there and drank two wineglasses
of vodky, two tumblers of beer, and a little
claret. It so happened that it would have been
difficult to refuse them.</p>

<p>In the <i>Nachimoff</i> all the partitions of the officers'
cabins have been broken down (so that there should
not be a fire). The furniture and the sleeping-bunks
have been taken away. The mattresses lie on the
floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>All the ships have prepared for battle, and
present a strange appearance. Everywhere there
are defences made out of chains, torpedo-nets, coal,
hawsers, sailors' hammocks, etc.&mdash;anything that
comes to hand. The ships have nothing in common
with what one is accustomed to see.</p>

<p>Three elephants have been brought here for
sale. It is not likely that any one will purchase
them.</p>

<p>The French cruiser has returned, and lies in the
bay by the side of our ships. It is known that a
steamer will pass Kamranh soon, taking about
280 poods of rice to Japan. The admiral evidently
hesitates about stopping her, fearing that he will
draw on himself the accusation of making a base
of a neutral port for the operations of his cruisers.
The captain of the steamer is not averse to giving
himself up, and will not hide or fly from pursuit.</p>

<p>Although we are lying at Kamranh, matters
stand like this&mdash;any moment we may expect an
order to weigh anchor. Everything is in readiness
for this.</p>

<p>The sailor who threw himself into the straits of
Malacca has been brought here. He belongs to
the <i>Nachimoff</i>, and not the <i>Alexander</i>, as I told you
before. Until the steamer picked him up he kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
himself afloat in the water for nearly ten hours.
To lighten himself he took everything off, only
leaving a piece of neck-cover on his shoulders, so
that the sun should not scorch him. He went
overboard at night, and they drew him out next
day. "It was trying, going on board the steamer,"
he said. "They all looked at me, and I had nothing
on."</p>

<p>We have to go 4,500 versts to Vladivostok. If
we do not leave here soon, we shall have dark,
moonless nights.</p>

<p><i>April 5th.</i>&mdash;Kamranh Bay. How tired I am to-day!
All day long I have been going from ship to
ship. They have not made me a dirk in the <i>Borodino</i>,
as the officer who promised it is lying ill.</p>

<p>The officers in the <i>Oleg</i> are angry because Admiral
Enquist is being transferred to her.</p>

<p>The <i>Aurora's</i> officers went shooting, but only killed
a dove. They did not go far from the shore.</p>

<p><i>April 6th.</i>&mdash;All the battleships and the <i>Aurora</i>
weighed anchor and went to sea. The rest of the
ships remained in the bay.</p>

<p>I smoked my last Russian cigarette.</p>

<p>Some of the transports are going to Saigon, and
perhaps will not return.</p>

<p>How news is fabricated! There is a Reuter's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
telegram (and Reuter publishes the most trustworthy
news) that in the fight with the Japanese
our fleet lost the torpedo-boats <i>Buiny</i> and <i>Blestyastchy</i>,
and two cruisers, the <i>Aurora</i> and the
<i>Donskoi</i>. Pleasant for those to read this telegram
whose nearest are in these ships. Although the
cook has not arrived, the food has improved. Provisions
were obtained from a steamer which arrived
from Saigon.</p>

<p>There is a Japanese mineral water called "Jansen."
A great deal of this water has been brought to the
fleet. I tried it, and it was not bad.</p>

<p>The people who sorted the provisions behaved
like wild wolves. There were some disgusting
scenes. The crew of the <i>Orel</i> broke open a box
and got drunk. For some reason a sailor threw
himself on the doctor with raised fists, but did not
succeed in hitting him. Two officers who happened
to be near seized the sailor and nearly killed him.
They beat his face into a pulp. It was horrible.
The French saw all this, and a nice opinion they
will have of the Russians.</p>

<p>A week before the <i>Orel</i> went to Saigon the captain
of the <i>Borodino</i> ordered 4,000 eggs, hams, etc., for
the crew. The crew in that ship will celebrate Easter
like human beings. It will not be so in other ships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>My notebook is finished. This is the second.
Can I obtain another? How much is written in
these two books!&mdash;all the history of our breakages
and repairs.</p>

<p>There is neither sight nor sound of the Japanese
fleet. Will they let the third fleet join us without
a fight? The <i>Gortchakoff</i>, <i>Jupiter</i>, <i>Kieff</i>, and
<i>Kitai</i> went to Saigon. Cruisers escorted them.
Perhaps these transports will bring us coal. There
is some belonging to Russia, but will the French
allow us to take it?</p>

<p>There are perpetual forest fires on shore. They
are a beautiful sight by night. Europeans say
that elephants, tigers, and panthers wander about
the shore at night. The beasts feel that they are
the owners. They even go up to the houses, out
of which it is not safe to venture. The place is
quite wild. The engineers who are making the
cutting for the railway complain that the elephants
cherish enmity against the telegraph-posts, and
constantly tear them up. It is an interesting
country, but not during such a cruise as
ours.</p>

<p>I have not been ashore up to the present, and
probably shall not go. How wearisome it all is to
me! It sometimes seems that this life on board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
will never end. A complete apathy comes over
me. Time is agonisingly long.</p>

<p><i>April 7th.</i>&mdash;An inquiry began to-day about the
sailor who attacked the officer in the <i>Orel</i>. If they
look on the matter seriously, he will have to end
his earthly existence.</p>

<p>There is a picture of the surrender of Port Arthur
in the French papers. Their contempt for the
Russians is growing.</p>

<p>They call us hares. There was one bright side
in all this war&mdash;the defence of Port Arthur, and
now that is besmirched.</p>

<p>The French cruiser is lying at Kamranh, and will
remain here as long as our fleet does not leave.
It looks as if she were guarding our ships from an
attack by the Japanese.</p>

<p>Cursed war! One is ashamed to look a foreigner
in the face.</p>

<p>Fifteen months, and not one victory! Rout
after rout, and there is nothing but disgrace and
humiliation.</p>

<p>There are several officers in the fleet who are
preparing to import their wives to Vladivostok.
How comparatively near that port lies! We have
come a tremendous journey, and only a small bit
remains. I wonder if we shall arrive there soon?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
We are now waiting for the third fleet, and the
Japanese are preparing to meet us. No reports
about them have reached us. We do not even
know where their fleet is. No doubt they know
our every movement. It is all horrible. It is
annoying when one sees how we do not know how
to make use of our strength.</p>

<p><i>April 8th.</i>&mdash;Our auxiliary cruisers returning
from escorting the transports to Saigon met a large
French steamer. There were many Russians on
board her. They were in uniform, and were evidently
returning from captivity. They waved their
caps and cheered our cruisers.</p>

<p>The French admiral came on board during lunch.
The meal was interrupted while he was paying a
visit, which was quite unexpected. Has he come in
order to request us to go? Yes, it is so. France
insists that we leave Kamranh. She is our ally,
too. It is proposed that we go back 600 versts and
there wait for the third fleet.</p>

<p>It is humiliating to go back and retreat from
our final goal. If we were to wait for the third
fleet, why did we leave Nosi Be? We only give
the Japanese a better chance of preparing themselves.
After all, it may happen that we shall go
on without waiting. Time has been lost, and our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
strength has not been augmented. The strength
of the Japanese will be concentrated in a smaller
sphere of activity, and consequently will be more
effective.</p>

<p>In what a horrible situation the second and
third fleets are now placed! Where and how
shall we effect a junction?</p>

<p>Had it not been for the third fleet, we might have
been at Vladivostok a long time ago. What will
the third fleet do?</p>

<p>By reckonings it has only passed Colombo. From
Petersburg it was ordered to go by the straits of
Sunda.</p>

<p><i>April 9th.</i>&mdash;An officer has come from the French
cruiser and brought a letter for the admiral. A
signal has been made to get up anchor at noon
to-morrow. It is still unknown where we are
going&mdash;to Vladivostok, or to some other bay. I
wonder if we shall be able to send letters to-morrow?
There is little hope of that, but in any case I shall
be ready.</p>

<p>South China Sea.&mdash;At one o'clock we weighed
anchor and went to sea. The transports and the
<i>Almaz</i> remained in the harbour, as they were coaling
from German colliers. The fleet will remain near
Kamranh till they are ready and can join us. Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
we shall steer then is unknown. Of course, we
might toss at sea waiting for the third fleet; but
coal! coal! The coaling question is the question
of life.</p>

<p>Two of our colliers are arrested. One at Singapore
and the other at Saigon. (Saigon, too, is French!
How this will please you!)</p>

<p>Our mails have been sent to the <i>Tamboff</i>, which,
after giving the fleet her load, will go to Saigon. If
she does not fall into the hands of the Japanese,
the letters will go to Russia.</p>

<p>There is an officer in the fleet who was in the
<i>Cesarevitch</i> on the 28th&mdash;that is, on the day on
which Witgift<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> was killed, and when our ships
fled so disgracefully wherever they could. From
what he says it is evident that the morale in
the ships was bad, and that they were all convinced
that they would return to Port Arthur; that the
Japanese suffered heavily, and if our ships had
held out for half an hour more the enemy's fleet
would have run. He related a good deal. Obviously,
we might easily have been the victors. The pity
was that the spirit of despair reigned. The <i>Cesarevitch</i>
hardly suffered at all. Wirenius did much
harm to the fleet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>
<p>All these disgraceful stories will come to light
after the war is over. Many heroes will then be
taken down from their pedestals.</p>

<p>If we only had had clever and daring leaders
the Port Arthur fleet might easily have destroyed
the Japanese. What a number of mistakes we
made! How little we valued our strength.</p>

<p>When one recalls it all one cannot account for
the fatal errors. We have to pay very dearly for
them. What follies they have perpetrated on
land! How many young lives have been lost!
How much will all this cost Russia!</p>

<p>The weather is becoming better. The ships are
going very slowly, keeping near Kamranh Bay with
lights covered. As usual, I stayed a long while on
the bridge. The rainy season will begin here soon,
as well as typhoons. How will the smaller vessels,
like torpedo-boats, get on?</p>

<p><i>April 10th.</i>&mdash;After lunch I am going to the <i>Tamboff</i>;
she is shortly going to Saigon. I shall post
this letter by her. One of the staff-officers should
have gone to the <i>Tamboff</i>, but they are nearly all
lying ill. I myself feel well, thank God!</p>

<p>Yesterday the <i>Oslyabya</i> buried another sailor.</p>

<p>There was mass to-day. It is Palm Sunday.
How time has flown! All night the ships remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
at sea. The night passed quietly. The <i>Isumrud</i>
fouled her screws with a chain. Divers were sent
down.</p>

<p>A steamer flying the Norwegian flag passed by.
She was examined, but nothing suspicious was found.
She was coming from Japan, and not going there.</p>

<p>I took my last letter and gave it to the captain
of the <i>Tamboff</i>. I handed him a franc for the stamp,
but he was offended and would not take it. I
tried to obtain cigarettes, but was unsuccessful.
The wardroom wanted to buy vodky from her, but
that too was a failure. The Norwegian steamer
which we examined this morning gave us the latest
papers. They are all English.</p>

<p>The discretion of the English press is extraordinary.
They consider Japan their ally, so they
purposely say nothing about her fleet. About ours
they print all the news they in one way or another
possess. It is not the English newspapers alone
that act thus. To do them justice, the Japanese
carefully conceal everything, and no one ever
rightly knows how many ships they have lost. Not
only ships, but up to the present no one knows
how many troops Japan can place in the field. It
was thought about 300,000, and already they have
placed nearly a million men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>The foreign press (English and French) puts our
losses from the beginning of the war at about
400,000 men. If that is the case, how many are
left to Linievitch? A mere trifle, about 200,000.
Could anything more disgraceful than this war be
imagined?</p>

<p><i>April 11th.</i>&mdash;From time to time merchant vessels
pass near the fleet. Our cruisers and torpedo-boats
go and examine them. A French steamer
came quite close, and a man in her expressed a
wish to hand something to the admiral in person.
I know now that he only announced the date the
third fleet passed Colombo, and said that nothing
fresh had happened in Manchuria.</p>

<p>A journey of only twelve or fifteen days separates
us from Vladivostok. There it is cold, and here it
is hot. Many of us will catch colds.</p>

<p>The crew are dressed badly. They have no
boots, and their clothes are worn out and ragged.</p>

<p>The Frenchman brought no news. We received
newspapers. From these it is evident that there
is a great discussion about Kamranh in France.
They fear the Japanese are there.</p>

<p>The news can scarcely be correct that Admiral
Nebogatoff's fleet (third fleet) has passed Colombo.
Its course is elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p><i>April 12th.</i>&mdash;How people are deceived sometimes!
It seemed to a good many in the <i>Suvaroff</i> yesterday
that there was a steam cutter between her and the
<i>Alexander III.</i> Instantly the fighting lanterns
were uncovered, and the rays of the searchlight
turned on to the suspicious place. They saw some
white breakers and foam. Many are inclined to
believe it was a submarine boat, disappearing under
water when they began to light up. In confirmation
of this supposition they point out that the
<i>Jemchug</i> saw something like a periscope (a sort of
tube which projects out of the water and allows
objects that are above to be seen in the submerged
boat).</p>

<p>Last evening I went to the upper deck cabin to
breathe the fresh air, lay on the sofa, and went
to sleep. At four o'clock I woke and went back to
my cabin. I have learnt to make cigarettes fairly
well. If paper and tobacco last, I can get on without
ready-made ones.</p>

<p>They are beginning to say that in a day or two
we shall leave Kamranh for another bay. To do
this we shall have to take in coal and provisions,
leaving the transports. The <i>Tamboff</i> apparently
will not come with us. Letters will not be taken
to Saigon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>A war vessel has been man&oelig;uvring in sight of
the fleet. Fearing that she is Japanese, the <i>Oleg</i> has
been sent to make certain. It is a false alarm. She
is probably the French cruiser <i>Déscartes</i>. There is
another steamer coming towards the fleet. The
question of going to another bay is settled.</p>

<p>We are going to the bay of Van Fong, which is
about one hundred versts north of Kamranh.
It is probably a wild and deserted spot.</p>

<p>I am bored and anxious, and long to be home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

DELAYS AT VAN FONG</h2>


<p><i>April 13th.</i>&mdash;At about nine o'clock the signalman
in an emotional voice announced that a warship
was coming towards us from the north, flying the
Russian naval flag and several signals. It turned
out to be the French cruiser <i>Déscartes</i>. She was
signalling to us, and hoisted the Russian flag so that
we should understand. There is news that a hospital-ship
has arrived at Batavia. It is said to be the
<i>Kostroma</i>, which is with Admiral Nebogatoff's fleet.</p>

<p>We are approaching the anchorage of Van Fong.
Some of the ships are already in the bay. The
French admiral clearly sympathises with us, and
if it depended on him we might lie where it is most
convenient for us. He purposely shuts his eyes to
a great deal. If he were not so disposed towards
us it would be awkward. He is aware, for instance,
where we have gone from Kamranh, but pretends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
that it is unknown to him. How much sometimes
depends on one man!</p>

<p>We are moving nearer and nearer to Vladivostok.
We have altogether come 28,500 versts. There
are 4,200 still left. Nearly seven-eighths of our
voyage is successfully accomplished.</p>

<p>All the ships have anchored. The <i>Suvaroff</i> is
coaling from a German steamer. In the latter some
of the crew are Chinamen, and perhaps there are
Japanese.</p>

<p>I forget if I told you that two Japanese were
noticed among the crew of the steamer <i>Dagmar</i>,
which brought provisions to Kamranh. How well
their intelligence service is organised! Wherever
you look there are Japanese spies. There is
authentic news that the ice at Vladivostok has
dispersed. Consequently, the Japanese might
undertake naval operations against it, if we do not
interfere in time. It will be a fine impediment if
they cut off Vladivostok by land, thus making it a
second Port Arthur.</p>

<p>Easter will soon be here, but it is not noticed in
the ship.</p>

<p>They live and eat as usual. There are no preparations&mdash;everywhere
is dirt and coal.</p>

<p><i>April 14th.</i>&mdash;In the torpedo-boats they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
assured that when we left Kamranh we were going
to Vladivostok. They never expected we should
anchor in some bay.</p>

<p>A sailor deserted at Kamranh. What will he do
there, on that savage shore? Another threw
himself into the sea from the <i>Rion</i>, having
cautiously put on a life-belt. He was successfully
taken out of the water and put on board the
<i>Rion</i>. On what do these people count?</p>

<p>The shore here is hilly, and rather pretty. There
is a small settlement. Chinese came near us in
boats. They sold chickens, ducks, bananas, etc.
The prices are heavy. They ask more than a
rouble for a fowl. They will not let a small pumpkin
go for less than fifty copecks.</p>

<p>I watched how the Chinese eat in the collier.
They eat very cleverly, with sticks. It is curious
to see so many people with pigtails. Sometimes
they fasten them up on their necks, and sometimes
hang them down their backs.</p>

<p>Admiral Folkersham is still unwell. He is in
bed. The stroke was not so slight as the doctors
said.</p>

<p>There are a lot of rats in my cabin. Their
audacity is so great that when I sit at table they
run about my feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chinese who come in junks, bringing provisions,
try to get rid of false three-rouble notes
made by the Japanese.</p>

<p>Several steamers have refused to go from the
south with freights for Japan. Their captains
explain that their crews do not care to go to those
seas where there are Russian ships.</p>

<p>They tried to explain to the sailors that they
themselves would lose nothing. The only risk was
of losing the ship. The persuasion had no effect,
so they were taken before a judge. The cause
of their not wishing to continue to voyage was
explained. "The Russian system," said the sailors,
"is to fire at a suspicious ship and save no one.
They acted thus in the North Sea. We do not
want to run the risk."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we do not do so; but the affair
in the North Sea brought us one advantage.
Merchant ships do not come near our fleet out of
curiosity&mdash;they give way to us. Now steamers
have no special pleasure in carrying contraband,
though they can procure it freely from America. The
Japanese were provided with coal long ago. The
coal which we sent to Vladivostok in large quantities
was captured by them.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Eva</i>, who was at Vladivostok<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
a comparatively short time ago, says that there is
no lack of provisions there. They want matches.
Perhaps he is only inventing. He also says that he
has read a telegram announcing that Nebogatoff's
fleet has passed Singapore. If this is true we should
effect a junction with it shortly.</p>

<p><i>April 15th.</i>&mdash;Last night a rat bit my foot. I
must take measures against them.</p>

<p>At the wireless station they are receiving signals.
They are rather incoherent messages. It seems as
if they meant to say "Nicholas" (the <i>Nikolai I.</i> is
with the third fleet). In any case, cruisers are being
sent to look out for Admiral Nebogatoff's fleet.</p>

<p>From the <i>Borodino</i> they announce that they are
getting similar signs.</p>

<p>An officer has just come from the <i>Sissoi</i> to report
that they have received a perfectly clear message,
in which the <i>Nicholas</i> asks for the situation of the
<i>Suvaroff</i>. Perhaps the <i>Nicholas</i> is actually signalling.
In any case, it will soon be made clear.
If Nebogatoff effects a junction, then, after his
ships have had a chance of being overhauled and
of coaling, we shall move on to Vladivostok. Now
we shall hardly wait for the <i>Slava</i> and other ships.
Probably they have not yet left Russia.</p>

<p>There has just been a solemn service. O God!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
what squalor! The crew and the choir stood
barefoot. All were in white. They tried to put
on clean clothes, but they were all torn. The
officers' clothes were bad also. All the same, the
service made a deep impression on me. It brought
back to my mind the last week I spent with you.</p>

<p>This is the second Easter I have spent in a ship
(the first in the <i>Apraxin</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>), and both with Rojdestvensky.</p>

<p>The engineer-constructor Kostenko, who was in
the battleship <i>Orel</i>, was washing his feet and somehow
cut his left foot with the basin. He was sent
to the hospital-ship <i>Orel</i>. He cut his tendon
achilles. The flagship's doctor said he required
hospital treatment. I do not yet know if his
wound is dangerous. There were six engineer-constructors
in the fleet. One has been sent to
Russia, and one will be in hospital. Thirty-three
per cent. of all the engineers have, so to speak,
fallen out of the ranks. For whom else is a similar
fate in store? Poor Kostenko! He is a talented
man. It is not a year since he left school. Perhaps
it is all for the best that he has gone to the hospital-ship
<i>Orel</i>. At all events, he will not have to undergo
the chances of a battle.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>
<p>In order not to disclose the position of the fleet,
we are forbidden to send letters and telegrams
from here. The question of the messages from
the <i>Nicholas</i> has been cleared up. Two French
ships were communicating with one another.</p>

<p>We have distinguished ourselves quite like
Russians. We came into the bay of Van Fong,
anchored, and arranged for an inspection of the
entrance to the bay. The bay itself was not
examined. Suddenly to-day a steamer was seen
moving towards the entrance. "What is this?"
"Where does she come from?" "Whose
steamer?" etc. The alarm was beaten. It appears
that it was a French steamer that has been
lying here for four days. How this will please you!
It is true the bay is very large, and there are many
commodious corners in it; but, nevertheless, it
does not excuse our carelessness. Why should
not Japanese torpedo-boats have hidden themselves
earlier, and attacked the fleet at night from the
side where they were least expected. It might
have happened, and they would certainly have
done it if they had known that we should not have
examined the bay, or that we should come here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
They say very truly that St. Nicholas the "Casual"
is protecting us.</p>

<p>The "Apes" and the "Anyhows" are fighting
indeed! I had to go and see Kostenko in the
hospital-ship <i>Orel</i>. I have been only on board her
once during the whole voyage, and then only because
it was absolutely necessary. I am not the only one
that feels like that towards her. All of us look on
her with aversion, and for some reason she is not
popular.</p>

<p>Admiral Nebogatoff, by my reckoning, can arrive
on the 19th or 23rd. Several days will be necessary
for his ships to repair defects, before the voyage to
Vladivostok.</p>

<p><i>April 16th.</i>&mdash;I went to the <i>Oleg</i>, had lunch there,
and stayed till one o'clock. Pity it was a Lenten
lunch. There was a sailor on board who had been
a clown. He trained a dog and did several tricks.
The cook's assistant there has received the name of
"Fire King," as he eats burning tow. There are
many musicians and actors there. The <i>Oleg</i> is a
happy ship. The officers live in a very friendly way.</p>

<p>Last night I waged war with the rats for a very
long time. They quite conquered. The worst of
it is that they do not mind running over my bed.
It is very repulsive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>I am preparing for Easter.</p>

<p>My servant almost by force compelled the washerman
to wash a tunic and a pair of trousers for me.
My shoes he has not been able to whiten.</p>

<p>I chatted for a long time with the navigator and
captain. The latter was seated in his deck cabin
without a tunic. He says it is nice like that, but
it seems strange.</p>

<p>The wardroom are collecting creeping plants and
green branches in preparation for Easter. All the
same, everything is so poor and wretched. Somehow
or other they have coloured the eggs, though there
is no paint. The bakers have baked the bread in
the shape of Easter cakes. There is, of course, no
paska,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> though there will be some at the admiral's
table.</p>

<p>In all the Chinese boats there are eyes painted in
the bows. This is done in order that the boat may
see where it is going.</p>

<p>Those of our transports which went to Saigon
have been allowed to take enough coal to last them
to Odessa. Of course, if they are wise they will fill
their holds as full as possible. As long as you have
permission to take it, you can always gain on the
amount. Do you remember in Vigo each ship was
only allowed to take 400 tons, and they all took
more than 800 each?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>
<p>To-day, for the first time during the voyage, the
agencies' telegrams have been published for the
information of everybody. The captain, first
lieutenant, and senior officer in the <i>Irtish</i> are
drinking heavily. They are nearly always drunk.
Wild scenes take place. Gloom and dissatisfaction
reign in that transport. It might end very
badly.</p>

<p>Do you know, it seems to me that the eighth will
be an important date for our fleet? Perhaps a
fight will take place on that date.</p>

<p>There are some polite wiseacres who are sending
their cards to all the ships. Could anything be
sillier at such a time, and under the present circumstances.</p>

<p>At 11.45 p.m. a service will begin, but no mass.
The Easter scenes in Russia will rise up in my
memory.</p>

<p><i>April 17th.</i>&mdash;Christos Voskress!<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> I woke later
than usual. I am late for the hoisting of the
colours. I have not yet left my cabin. Easter is
being greeted. During the service half the officers
and crew did not leave the loaded guns. The church
was carefully covered, so that light should not
penetrate outside. The stuffiness was intolerable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>
<p>The service went off with much ceremony. All
were in white. The altar screen was white, and the
priest's vestments also. The church was abundantly
decorated with tropical plants. Everything was
covered with them, and garlands were suspended
from the roof. The church is so low that after it
was arranged and decorated it looked almost like
a cave.</p>

<p>We broke our fast at supper. The table was
fairly well spread. No one knew in Russia that
the fleet would spend Easter in the bay of Van Fong.
Everything went on in the ordinary way. After
6 p.m. coal and stores were taken in, and all go
about dirty.</p>

<p>Do you remember last Easter? It was also out
of the common.</p>

<p>About three o'clock I went to the <i>Borodino</i>, and
stayed there till six. Every officer in her received
an egg and an Easter cake, and they sent eggs and
cakes to the hospital-ship <i>Orel</i>. This was the only
ship that did this. The others did not trouble
about their sick. They promised to get me paper
and tobacco.</p>

<p>Yesterday a mining cutter from the <i>Borodino</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
was on guard duty, and met three Chinese boats
with fish. The cutter examined them. One of the
Chinamen seemed suspicious. They thought he was
Japanese. He was taken into the cutter, but,
profiting by a favourable moment, he jumped
into the water, dived, quickly gained the shore,
and ran off. A paper was found in the boat.
It was apparently a simple permission for them
to catch fish at Van Fong, and was written in
Chinese.</p>

<p>I have prickly heat. It is horrible.</p>

<p>In the evenings, after dinner, I often go and sit
on the forebridge. I was there to-day and talked
with the captain. He was going about barefooted,
and without a tunic.</p>

<p><i>April 18th.</i>&mdash;The famous Meteorological Station
near Shanghai gives information about a typhoon
which is now on the China Sea. Will it catch
us? Typhoons are very frequent. Their number
depends on the time of the year. We are afraid
that our torpedo-boats will not succeed in reaching
Vladivostok safely, owing to them. If we
go by the strait of Korea we shall have an affair
with Japanese torpedo-boats and submarines. It
would be a good thing if it were rather rough (like
we had it in the German Ocean) when we pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
through the strait. It would be more difficult for
their submarines and torpedo-boats to attack us.</p>

<p>The last few days have been close and damp.
My tobacco is mildewed. To economise in cigarettes
I have to cut them in halves.</p>

<p>Yesterday my servant Golovko stole a bottle of
brandy from the sideboard in the wardroom, and
got drunk. He is no longer to be one of the servants
of the staff. I shall have another. It is a pity, as
I was accustomed to Golovko, and he knew my
ways.</p>

<p>I smoked a cigarette with opium, and am now
inclined to sleep. I hope Nebogatoff and his fleet
will come soon. Perhaps he will bring a mail.
Everything is possible with us.</p>

<p><i>April 19th.</i>&mdash;There is a telegram that Nebogatoff
passed Penang on the 15th, and not on the 13th.
We may expect him here on the 21st.</p>

<p>There have been disorders in the battleship <i>Orel</i>
about a cow. Some one broke her leg. They killed
her, and gave her meat to the crew for dinner.
The crew complained loudly that they were fed
with meat from animals that had died.</p>

<p>The admiral himself went to the <i>Orel</i> this morning,
and raised thunder and lightning. The captain,
officers, and crew alike suffered. True, the crew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
of the <i>Orel</i> are a bad lot. Among the sailors are
many who have been punished. Do you remember
I told you they were not sailors, but convicts, in
the <i>Orel</i>. Think of what has happened to this
ship&mdash;her sinking, grounding, the attempt to damage
both engines, etc. The captain is in a great measure
responsible for the insubordination of the crew. For
some reason he looks at their offences through his
fingers, and even reproves the officers if they try
to carry out a more severe discipline&mdash;and not only
discipline, but plain order.</p>

<p>There is news that a French warship will arrive
here to-morrow. The following comedy will be
played out for appearance' sake. All the battleships,
the <i>Oleg</i>, and the <i>Aurora</i> will get up anchor
and go to sea at 6.30 a.m. The transports and other
ships will move ahead, as if they were preparing to
go. In reality they will only change their position,
leaving places for Nebogatoff's fleet.</p>

<p>Is not all this neutrality and international right
a farce? Here we have been half a month close
to the theatre of war, in the waters of a neutral
power. All our ships would have left Van
Fong if it had not been that we feared the
typhoon.</p>

<p>You will no doubt receive this letter when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
are at Vladivostok. It will be a pity if the letters
fall into the hands of the Japanese.</p>

<p>I am picturing to myself the fight. An artillery
fight does not appear to me to be so terrible and
destructive as a torpedo attack. Projectiles could
not sink a battleship or cruiser, but a torpedo might
very easily, if it hit.</p>

<p>We weighed anchor and went to sea. On going
out of Van Fong we met the French cruiser. We
saluted each other. She signalled that she had
some letters for us, which she will hand over to the
<i>Almaz</i> in the bay. The cruiser passed into the bay,
and our ships lay close to her with engines stopped.
This cruiser, the <i>Guichen</i>, will leave, and then we
shall return. It is a regular farce&mdash;and a farce to
our advantage&mdash;that is played, thanks to the French
admiral. Were it not for him the French Government
would have driven us out, and there would
have been an end to the business.</p>

<p><i>April 20th.</i>&mdash;The French cruiser left, but we
passed the night at sea. There is no news about
Nebogatoff's fleet. It is strange. He ought to
have passed Singapore, and it should have been
known to us by now.</p>

<p>The admiral is convinced that the Japanese will
try to sink Nebogatoff's ships before the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
join us. Perhaps they will not succeed in sinking
them, and only damage them. They will then have
to be repaired, and the voyage to Vladivostok will
be put off for an indefinite period.</p>

<p>At eleven I heard the sound of a rocket being
discharged. I put on my tunic and went on deck.
Men were rushing about everywhere, hurrying to
the stations for battle. Shouting the question,
"One or two?" They were asking about the
rockets. "One" means the fleet is to exercise for
general quarters; "two" means the actual alarm,
when the enemy is real. There was one rocket.
We frequently have general night alarms, but the
men are not yet accustomed to them.</p>

<p><i>April 21st.</i>&mdash;We are entering the bay. A torpedo-boat
will only go to-morrow for the telegrams.
That means that we can only then count on knowing
something about the third fleet. For the dispatch
of letters, evidently, we have to turn to the German
collier. We ourselves can do nothing, like helpless
children, although there is a post-office at hand.</p>

<p>My servant Golovko is transferred to another
ship. He came to me and nearly cried. He asked
me to verify my things. Of course, I did not do
that.</p>

<p><i>April 22nd.</i>&mdash;I have not been able to write to you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
earlier to-day. I have been visiting ships. I went
on board the <i>Irtish</i>. The atmosphere there is
heavy. The first lieutenant is to be tried for some
nonsense with the captain, by a special court. It
is appointed for the 24th inst.</p>

<p>When I was in the <i>Gromky</i> a boat came to her in
which were two adult Annamese and three boys.
The boys ranged themselves in a row, folded their
hands with the palms together (prayer fashion),
and bowed down to their feet. I asked what they
were doing. "They beg that we should buy them,"
was the answer. Perhaps the boys did not beg quite
so much, but the traffic in children is beyond doubt.
Boys, they say, are valued at five or ten francs,
considerably cheaper than a pig. There were some
occasions when children were bought, and they tried
to make servants of them. These experiments
nearly always ended badly. The boys were spoilt,
and it was difficult to get rid of them.</p>

<p>Our captain, to whom I related the affair in the
torpedo-boat, took it into his head that I wanted
to buy a boy, and began to reprove me severely.
With great difficulty I assured him that I did not
want to buy any one. It would be a nice thing to
arrive home with a ten- or twelve-year-old Chinaman!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>A suspicious thing has occurred. The French
admiral, whom the captain of the <i>Bodry</i> saw to-day,
spoke of the movements and stations of the
French men-of-war in great detail, but not a word
did he mention about the torpedo-boats which
ought to pass Van Fong. The <i>Donskoi</i>, which was
patrolling with the <i>Ural</i>, at about two o'clock
saw two torpedo-boats going north. At first they
were without colours, but afterwards hoisted
French. The <i>Donskoi</i> was satisfied, and did not
trouble to go nearer them. The torpedo-boats
passed unimpeded. The admiral and others are
convinced that they were Japanese.</p>

<p>The rays of a searchlight are seen sometimes
from the side of the open sea. It is evidently from
a warship. The <i>Donskoi</i> reports that she sees the
rays, and that is all. Whose can they be? If
they are the <i>Ural's</i>, what is her reason for being
silent? Taken in conjunction with the appearance
of the torpedo-boats by day, these rays are very
suspicious, even if it is the <i>Ural</i>. If she has lighted
up, it means that either she has seen or suspected
something wrong. The whole fleet are ordered to
increase their attention. Had the <i>Donskoi</i> gone
nearer to the torpedo-boats which hoisted French
colours, the affair would have been clearer. If they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
were Japanese, how they will jeer at our foolish
confidence! We saw the colours and were satisfied.
As if it is difficult to hoist whichever flag you
please!</p>

<p><i>April 23rd.</i>&mdash;To-day is the Empress's name-day.
We had prayers and a salute. All this time Annamese
boats have been lying near our ships. You
should have seen how they fled when the firing
began.</p>

<p>Gradually everything is going. I have begun
to carry tobacco for rolling cigarettes in old
envelopes. It is more convenient than having it
in a cigar-case.</p>

<p>There is no news of Nebogatoff. The officers in
the <i>Aurora</i> have started a totalisator on his arrival.</p>

<p>The following idea is worrying me. Only vessels
of less than seventy-five feet in width can enter
the Vladivostok dock. I cannot say if this is true.
Our new battleships (<i>Suvaroff</i>, <i>Alexander</i>, <i>Borodino</i>,
and <i>Orel</i>) have a width of seventy-six feet. If it
is so, in case of necessity it will be impossible to
put them into dock. For some reason the width
and measures of the docks are considered a secret,
and do not find a place in books of naval inquiry,
so that no one remembers the measures. God
grant that my fears are not justified!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>The duty cruiser patrolling reports that she sees
three ships moving together in one direction. She
is ordered at any moment to go at full speed.</p>

<p><i>April 24th.</i>&mdash;Lights are moving near the bay.
The patrol steamer signals some confused message.
Can these ships be relied on? It is said that the
captain of one of them does not conceal his desire
to disarm. He does not conduct himself as he
should under the eyes of the flagship. For instance,
he is ordered to patrol three miles from the shore,
and he goes out thirty. Our fleet with its necessities
appears to him to be something hostile. For some
reason there exists a presentiment among many
that of the four new battleships the <i>Alexander III.</i>
will perish during the war.</p>

<p>At last Nebogatoff declares himself. A torpedo-boat
which went to Natrang to-day brought a
telegram saying that the third fleet passed
Singapore at 4 a.m. on the 22nd, and that she
would join us on the 27th. Evidently all is well
with it. Where has it been lingering a whole
week? From Penang to Singapore is only a three
days' journey. It means we shall soon leave
here.</p>

<p>Probably my foreboding about the number eight
will come to pass. I forget if I told you that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
seems to me that the number eight will play a
great <i>rôle</i> in the fate of our fleet.</p>

<p>The French admiral (Janquières), who is so
friendly towards us, has sent the admiral some
poetry composed by himself about Port Arthur
and Stössel.</p>

<p>I wonder in what condition the third fleet will
arrive? What news will it bring? Will there be
any mails, and of what date? Will it bring us
tobacco, paper, and cigarettes. It left Russia more
than four months after we did.</p>

<p>When it started we were already at Nosi Be.
We have had absolutely no news from Manchuria.
What is going on there?</p>

<p>Janquières, the French admiral, has arrived in
the <i>Guichen</i>, and has proposed that we should leave
Van Fong. To-morrow we shall probably go to the
bay that was examined not long ago by the <i>Roland</i>.
The <i>Guichen</i> has just left. There are many in her
down with fever. Owing to this the band did not play.</p>

<p>Thanks to all the conferences, we were late for
dinner.</p>

<p>To-morrow the <i>Jemchug</i>, <i>Isumrud</i>, <i>Dnieper</i>, and
<i>Rion</i> are going to meet the third fleet, in order to
inform it of our whereabouts.</p>

<p>When reporting the approach of a French warship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the captain of an auxiliary cruiser innocently
asked if he should examine her. I am curious
to know how he would examine a warship. There
are many similar cases of sharp wit, and frequently
no attention is paid to such pranks. The more
I hear of the personnel and the morale in
the Port Arthur fleet, the less astonished I
am at its destruction, and the less pitiable it
seems to me. The greatest pity is the loss of
the ships.</p>

<p>The steamer <i>Eridan</i>, under French colours, arrived
from Saigon with provisions at 9.30 a.m. I was not
expecting anything, when suddenly a sailor came
and handed me your letters. Apparently Günsburg
sent them to Saigon under cover to his brother
Mess (the real surname of the Günsburgs is
Mess).</p>

<p>I was quite beside myself with joy. I am still
more delighted at receiving news that is only a
month old. At that moment the flag diving-officer
came into my cabin on business. I scarcely remember
what I said to him.</p>

<p>There were very few letters. I was the only
one of the staff who received any. To-day is a red-letter
day for me. I sat down to write to you, when
the senior staff-officer, S&mdash;&mdash;, came and proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
that I should take 1,000 cigarettes off him, out of
the 4,000 he had received. They are Russian
cigarettes that M. Mess sent. I am set up in smokes
for a long time now.</p>

<p>Captain Pollis, who has recently been our secret
agent in Batavia, arrived in the <i>Eridan</i>, and also
Lieutenant M&mdash;&mdash;, who broke out of Port Arthur
in a torpedo-boat shortly before its fall. They will
both remain in the fleet. The <i>Eridan</i> leaves to-day.
It will be nice to send a letter by her.</p>

<p><i>April 25th.</i>&mdash;After receiving your letters I rushed
about the <i>Suvaroff</i>, and decided to go to the <i>Borodino</i>.
When I arrived there the captain was asleep.
They woke him. We sat down, and drank tea,
and he gave me sweets. He began to plan how we
should travel about Europe together after the war
is over. We sat down with a tantalus and chatted.
Just then they brought him letters from the <i>Suvaroff</i>.
It was a pity I did not know there was a
mail for him. I might have brought it with
me.</p>

<p>It so happened that fate gladdened only two
officers with news from home. In the <i>Suvaroff</i> I
was the only happy one. To-day was a holiday
for me indeed.</p>

<p>At six o'clock I went back to the <i>Suvaroff</i> in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
<i>Borodino's</i> mining cutter, and to my horror found
that the mail had already been sent to the <i>Eridan</i>.
I stuck a 5-franc stamp on to my letter. Other
people gave me some of theirs, and I made up a
large packet, addressing it to M. Mess. I then sent
it by boat to the <i>Eridan</i>, which might at any
moment get up anchor and go to Saigon.</p>

<p>The Annamese are queer people. They value
brass and silver buttons at more than five francs
each. The crew, of course, profit by this, settle
their accounts with buttons, and trade in them
also.</p>

<p>The third fleet has not yet arrived, but letters
have been received for it <i>viâ</i> Günsburg. There
will be a mail in it for us. I count on receiving
thirty-three letters from you.</p>

<p>Do you remember I told you I was afraid that
Günsburg's steamer <i>Regina</i> would fall into the
hands of the Japanese. It seems that she was
wrecked in the Mozambique Channel.</p>

<p><i>April 26th.</i>&mdash;We did not weigh anchor in time
to-day. The French cruiser came again to drive
us out.</p>

<p>A message has been received from the <i>Vladimir
Monomach</i>, which is ahead of Nebogatoff's fleet,
that they are coming in complete array. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
shall soon be joined by them. I am curious to
know what sort of a fleet it is, what its morale is
like, and what sort of captains. Many of them
are laughed at. They are famous for their war
service; but war changes men, and good ones are
sometimes found among the bad, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>2 p.m.&mdash;The smoke, masts, and funnels of Nebogatoff's
fleet have appeared. Every one is in a
great state of excitement, and rushes to the bridge.
Binoculars are brought up on deck. At last we
shall proceed. There is no need to wait longer.</p>

<p>When the signalling began, we asked the <i>Monomach</i>
the name of her first lieutenant, to make
certain that she was not a Japanese ship. She
replied, and asked the <i>Suvaroff</i> the same question.</p>

<p>The <i>Dnieper</i>, it appears, saw the third fleet last
night; but fearing that it was the Japanese, hastily
retreated. She was sent in order to join herself
to Nebogatoff. I am going on the bridge. The
fleets are just joining. They are nearing each
other. They are beginning to salute.</p>

<p>10 p.m.&mdash;O Lord, I do not know how to begin!
My head is completely silly. I do not know what
to say. I am happy, satisfied, glad. I want to
tell you everything, and am afraid shall not succeed.
I shall get confused and forget.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>As Nebogatoff's fleet approached we all crowded
on deck. I put on my new cap for the great occasion.</p>

<p>First came the <i>Apraxin</i>. Could I have thought
when I was working in her five years ago that I
should see her here! How strange the <i>Apraxin</i>,
<i>Ushakoff</i>, and <i>Seniavin</i> seemed! So short, and
such long funnels! They reminded me of overgrown
children with angular limbs.</p>

<p>At four o'clock Nebogatoff came on board the
<i>Suvaroff</i>. He greeted Rojdestvensky with a kiss.
The staff were invited to drink champagne to the
happy union of the fleets. At table Nebogatoff
spoke of his voyage and its success. His ships
steamed ideally, without breakdowns. At night
his fleet steamed without lights. Every one was
informed about his arrival at Penang. His passage
through the straits of Malacca took him two days
and a half.</p>

<p>They brought a mail in the cutter which brought
Nebogatoff from the <i>Nicolai I.</i> to the <i>Suvaroff</i>.
Though it is not customary to get up from the
admiral's table, I could not sit there long, and left
to examine the mail. It was already sorted in heaps.</p>

<p>My mail had been taken to my cabin. I ran
there, and did not know which to open first&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
letters or parcels. I opened the parcels. There
were socks, handkerchiefs, shoulder-straps, sweets,
cigarettes, soap, eau-de-Cologne, scents, brushes,
etc. My eyes opened wide. My servant helped
me to sort and wipe everything. It was all stuck
together. How joyfully I separated all this! Indeed,
I cannot say all I feel at present. I must
calm myself.</p>

<p>The eau-de-Cologne and scents have travelled
well. The jam, although it was soldered up,
leaked. The cigarettes are a little spoilt, but they
can be smoked. Newspapers I could not read.
I only read the parts marked by you.</p>

<p>I am writing in broken sentences. Perhaps
to-morrow I shall have to send this letter; now my
head is in a whirl.</p>

<p><i>April 27th.</i>&mdash;Perhaps the <i>Kostroma</i>, which has
not joined the fleet yet, will bring another mail.
You see how spoilt I am. My head is stupid
to-day, but I am so pleased and happy at having
received all you sent me.</p>

<p>I wanted to write to you, when two torpedo-boats
collided&mdash;the <i>Grosny</i> and <i>Bezuprechny</i>.
They must be quickly repaired. We are at
sea, and the torpedo-boats are in harbour thirty
versts away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>4 p.m.&mdash;I sat a long time in the whaler, waiting
an opportunity to go to the <i>Buistry</i>. She took
me to Port Dayot Bay, where some of the fleet are
lying. I go back to the <i>Suvaroff</i> at dawn.</p>

<p>The fleet in general received few mails. Every
one is complaining, but I am satisfied. I saw an
officer in a torpedo-boat washing a tunic for himself.
It was a strange sight.</p>

<p><i>April 28th.</i>&mdash;My work in the <i>Bezuprechny</i> was
successfully carried out. I returned to the fleet in
the torpedo-boat <i>Bodry</i>. We met the fleet returning
to Van Fong Bay to coal, as the open sea was
rough.</p>

<p>We leave here to-morrow morning. The French
sternly drive us away, but we stay on. It is impertinence.
Port Dayot is really the same as Van
Fong, as it is a gulf joined to it by a wide strait.
It is very beautiful. The shores are hilly and
covered with thick wood. In the corner of the
bay lies a wrecked French gunboat, which is being
dismantled. There are a lot of goats, peacocks,
monkeys, elephants, and wild beasts on shore.</p>

<p>Yesterday I dined in the <i>Bezuprechny</i>. The
night was calm. They brought officers over from
the neighbouring boats. They all live in a very
friendly way. It is their custom to give each other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
presents on their names-days and birthdays.
Sometimes the presents are very curious ones.</p>

<p>They invited me to spend the night, but I refused.
I went to the <i>Kamchatka</i>. A cabin was ready for
me there, but I preferred spending the night half-sitting
in a long chair, in the fresh air on deck.
At six o'clock a torpedo-boat came for me. In the
<i>Kamchatka</i> they begged me to take several things
to the <i>Suvaroff</i>. I did not do so.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the hospital-ship <i>Orel</i>, the crew
were sent into the hold for something. There were
poisonous gases, and they began to suffocate. All except
one escaped. The deceased was buried to-day.</p>

<p>The shoulder-straps you sent me are not uniform.
They are an ensign's. I made a present of them
to an engineer, Krimer. He was so pleased that
he treated the wardroom to champagne. I did
not like to give them away, but persuaded myself
that I must not be a dog in the manger.</p>

<p>I treated some of the others to the almond cake.
It smells somewhat strange, and some insects like
beetles have established themselves in it.</p>

<p>We move on to Vladivostok the day after to-morrow.
Many fear danger. After your letters I
feel bold, and look to the future with hope. There
is an idea that the Japanese fleet will not fight a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
fleet action until we arrive off Vladivostok. They
will feign torpedo attacks, while in the meantime
they will cut us off by land. Who can foretell the
events?</p>

<p>For God's sake do not be anxious at not receiving
letters or telegrams for a very long time. We are
passing along uninhabited shores. Letters will be
sent as occasions offer. Our postal arrangements
are bad. Some of your letters to me are lost, and
some of your October letters I have only just
received.</p>

<p><i>April 29th.</i>&mdash;We went to sea early this morning.
A steamer passed close to the fleet, making an
attempt to escape. Our torpedo-boats and scouting
cruiser overtook her. She hoisted English colours.
We only questioned, and did not examine her. She
said she was going from Japan to the south, carrying
coolies. We let her go.</p>

<p>We remain tossing on the sea. We shall leave
here either to-morrow evening or day after. It is
said that the hospital-ship will not join the fleet at
all. Do you know, the number of ships in the fleet
is now fifty-two? Some of the transports are at
Saigon, or it would have been greater still.</p>

<p><i>April 30th.</i>&mdash;The <i>Kostroma</i> has come, with a mail,
it seems.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

PREPARING FOR BATTLE</h2>


<p><i>May 1st.</i>&mdash;The <i>Kostroma</i> called at Saigon and
brought a mail.</p>

<p>The last letter I received was dated March 28th.
It is quick. And all because Günsburg sent it on.
All the ships have received an enormous mail. They
were a long time sorting it.</p>

<p>To-day, May 1st, we left Port Dayot for Vladivostok.
We go by the South China Sea. Our fleet
now consists of fifty ships. Of these, nine are
torpedo-boats, and two hospital-ships&mdash;a great
armada. Probably we shall go round Formosa,
and through the straits of Korea. There will hardly
be a fleet action before Vladivostok. We must
expect submarine boats and frantic torpedo-boat
attacks.</p>

<p><i>May 2nd.</i>&mdash;Our course is so laid that when we
have passed the southern extremity of Formosa we
shall go to the east of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>At night we crossed the only course by which
ships usually go from north to south. We met two
steamers. They will report the course chosen by
the fleet. Now we are moving in a part of the
China Sea by which ships do not usually go. They
are beginning to talk about coaling. They wish to
arrange it to-morrow morning. The torpedo-boats
are being towed by the transports. Meanwhile,
there are no mishaps or breakdowns.</p>

<p>9 p.m.&mdash;The battleship <i>Orel</i> has delayed us for a
short time. Something was damaged in her. Our
course is shaped between Formosa and Luzon, one
of the Philippine Islands. It is exactly seven months
to-day since the fleet left Russia.</p>

<p>The sea is almost calm, and the ports can be
kept open without danger. Hiding the lights, we
are steaming with only a limited number. A
collision would be difficult, as it is a bright,
moonlight night. At present everything is going
quietly. I rose to-day at nearly 9 a.m., was late
for breakfast, and had to have it alone in my
cabin.</p>

<p><i>May 4th.</i>&mdash;To-morrow we coal&mdash;probably the
last coaling at sea.</p>

<p>It is proposed that when the coal from the <i>Tamboff</i>
and <i>Mercury</i> has been taken, they shall leave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
fleet and return to Saigon. It will be possible to
send letters by them.</p>

<p>Near Shanghai the remaining transports will leave
us. Only the naval ones will remain (<i>Kamchatka</i>,
<i>Irtish</i>, and <i>Anadir</i>), and the <i>Korea</i>, in which are
war stores. If this is carried out, the admiral
himself will seek a fleet action with the Japanese
fleet before our arrival at Vladivostok.</p>

<p>10 p.m.&mdash;They are receiving signs at the telegraph
(wireless) station. No one attaches any importance
to them. In the ship it is surprisingly quiet. They
were more perturbed when the English cruisers
surrounded us in the Atlantic. I am quite composed
and do not worry.</p>

<p>Gulls are seen; the shore is not far off. The
moon is shining, and it is as bright as day. By
such light it will be difficult for torpedo-boats to
attack, but convenient for submarines. The sea is
calm.</p>

<p>Soon it will not be so hot. To-morrow the sun
will be at its zenith&mdash;for us, the sixth and last
time.</p>

<p>Formosa is near. All are interested in it. With
luck we shall be at Vladivostok in twelve or fifteen
days.</p>

<p>All my preparations for battle consist in putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
my things in order. Coaling will begin at 6 a.m.,
if the weather permits.</p>

<p>At Port Dayot, not only did the transport
<i>Gustave Lerche</i>, and the water-tank steamer <i>Count
Stroganoff</i>, leave the fleet, but also the transport
<i>Keenia</i>.</p>

<p>The latter is a floating workshop. Was it worth
while bringing her here? She has little speed,
and the workmen say is badly fitted out. I
have not been there. It so happens that I have
not been on board any of the ships that came
with Nebogatoff.</p>

<p><i>May 5th</i> (8 a.m.).&mdash;The fleet is coaling. The sea
is calm, but the swell is so great that the battleships
are rolling. It is hot. Very soon it will be cold.
How shall we stand it after the tropics? There
will be a large number of sick.</p>

<p><i>May 6th.</i>&mdash;<i>South China Sea.</i></p>

<p>Yesterday the <i>Tamboff</i> and <i>Mercury</i> went to
Saigon. The mail was given to the latter. When
the coaling was finished, the fleet went on full speed
ahead. In the evening I drew the disposition of
all ships for a lithographic stone, in the event of
floating mines being observed.</p>

<p>It is proposed to send the <i>Rion</i>, <i>Dnieper</i>, <i>Kuban</i>,
and <i>Terek</i> one after another for cruiser operations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
They decided not to send the <i>Ural</i>, as they do not
trust her. It was her captain who openly boasted
about disarming.</p>

<p>Last night I sat on the after-bridge, and waited
the result of the <i>Oleg's</i> chase after a steamer.
After conversing with those around I fell asleep.
At one o'clock I woke, and went to sleep in my
cabin. It would have been worth while waiting a
little longer.</p>

<p>At two o'clock the <i>Oleg</i> reported that, on examination,
it proved that the steamer, as the captain
explained, had no documents. He himself did not
know all her cargo. There was kerosene. She was
going to Japan from New York. The heavily laden
steamer was ordered to be brought to the fleet,
was arrested as suspicious, and sent to Vladivostock
for examination by the prize court. A crew of our
men and petty officers were placed on board. One
of them from the <i>Suvaroff</i> was appointed captain.
The former captain and engineer were left in the
steamer as passengers&mdash;of course, without any
authority. The rest of the crew were brought to
our ships.</p>

<p>On being questioned, they gave different evidence.
Several sailors affirmed that there were
guns and ammunition among the cargo.  One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
sailor, at the very beginning, when he was out of
his captain's sight, showed with his hands that
there was something round in the steamer.</p>

<p>It was difficult to find out where the steamer
came from. They all named different ports. The
steamer (<i>Oldhamia</i>) will go with our crew to Vladivostok,
<i>viâ</i> the Sungari Straits. Is this a good
thing? The Japanese may chance upon her on
her way. Would it not have been simpler to make
certain that she carries contraband, take her crew
from her, and sink her? Her capture wasted a lot
of time. All the fleet lay motionless until twelve
noon. She was provisioned, coaled, and the crew
transferred, etc. She had very little coal, not
enough to get her to Vladivostok. They began to
coal her from the <i>Livonia</i>, a transport which came
with Nebogatoff.</p>

<p>From twelve noon we went at a slow pace&mdash;twelve
knots. The <i>Livonia</i> is going alongside the
captured steamer, to which she is made fast, and is
coaling her.</p>

<p>How we love to make a secret of everything&mdash;not
unfrequently to our disadvantage! Our staff
have telegrams giving the names of the steamers
going to Japan with contraband goods. These
telegrams were needed to-day to see if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
captured vessel was not among the ships indicated.
The telegrams proved to be confidential, and had
been placed in a safe, which was hidden in the event
of a fight.</p>

<p>What is the use of telling us at all, if we, considering
it confidential, do not make use of our evidence?
It is astonishing! They should have published the
names of steamers with contraband throughout the
fleet, in order that each ship should know about
them. But with us this is a "great secret." It
is simply inconceivable. To conceal the names
of steamers serving in the interest of Russia is
sensible, but to hide from our own people the names
of the friends of Japan is simply folly. It is
always and everywhere thus with us.</p>

<p>When they were busied with the <i>Oldhamia</i> in
the morning, two more steamers were perceived,
one laden and the other empty. One of them
was conducted to the fleet by the <i>Jemchug</i>. Of
course, it was the empty one. She was under
Norwegian colours, belonged to Bergen; her name
was <i>Oscar II.</i> She went off to Japan. She had
already served Japan for two years (some
company). We let her go. She audaciously cut
through the line of our ships. Perhaps she was
purposely sent by Japan as a scout. She can now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
inform them where she saw us. She may have
taken some photographs, and counted the ships.
Even if she has not been sent purposely, she will
nevertheless make known our position.</p>

<p>We have lost and wasted much time. This
loss does not pay. We are wasting the bright,
moonlight nights.</p>

<p>On the occasion of the Emperor's birthday a
salute was fired, and there were prayers.</p>

<p>Sorting out my books, I found a clean notebook
and copy-book. They came at an opportune
moment, as I had finished the last.</p>

<p>7 p.m.&mdash;They are beginning to swear at having
let the <i>Oscar</i> go without examining her.</p>

<p>The weather is beginning to be doubtful. Perhaps
there will be a typhoon. The fleet will suffer severely.</p>

<p>They have just published a list of vessels which
are known to be carrying contraband to Japan.
Of course, the list only contains a portion of them.
What have they not in them! Horses, guns,
projectiles, powder, gun-cotton, explosives, blankets,
milk, rails, engines, cables, iron, steel, copper, armour
plates, conserves, rifles, grenades, shrapnel, wire,
steam cutters, railway material. One steamer is
specially fitted for raising our ships sunk at Port
Arthur!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p><i>May 7th.</i>&mdash;<i>Pacific Ocean.</i></p>

<p>The fleet is in the Pacific. For some reason it
is also called the "Great." We passed by the
islands of the Batan (<i>sic</i>) group. They say there
are volcanoes there. I did not see them from
the ship.</p>

<p>The motion of the sea interfered with the coaling
of the captured steamer. If the coal does not last
her to Vladivostok, she is ordered to call at Korsakovsky
port (in Sagalien). There are still two
hundred of our men, who were coaling, on board her.
Owing to the motion they could not be taken off.
They will try to take them off to-morrow.</p>

<p>There are about 2,800 versts left to Vladivostok.</p>

<p>Yesterday I began to prepare for battle. My
preparations were very simple. I opened a trunk,
and without more ado thrust in everything&mdash;ikons,
letters, and photographs of you.</p>

<p><i>May 8th.</i>&mdash;To-morrow we are again to coal at
sea. Will there soon be an end of this coaling
bacchanalia? To-day we pass the Tropic of Cancer,
and leave the tropics.</p>

<p>When I slept last night the rats began to gnaw
my toes. I am heartily tired of this kind of life,
with its dirt and hardships. The <i>Oldhamia</i> has
left the fleet, and will go alone to Vladivostok or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Korsakovsky port, or even to Petropavlovsk, if
fogs interfere. The <i>Kuban</i> was left by her, to give
her a hundred tons of coal, if it is possible. The
<i>Oldhamia</i> will then go on shore, and the <i>Kuban</i>
will cruise about to capture contraband.</p>

<p>The <i>Oldhamia</i> is a new ship; her construction
was only finished last year. She was occupied earlier
with contraband. She took something for Japan
to Dalny, and for the Russians to Vladivostok.</p>

<p>At first the captain of the <i>Oldhamia</i> behaved in
a very off-hand manner. He jeered at us, and
praised the Japanese. He did not expect we would
take him from his steamer. When it was explained
that he would be taken, he sang another tune, and
even cried on leaving her.</p>

<p>The English who remained succeeded in playing
a dirty trick. They opened the Kingstons in the
engine-room, and the steamer began to sink. Our
crew quickly found the open Kingston, and closed
it. They also tore off the marks of the stocks
showing where each stock goes. Our men had to
find out. Yesterday, when our crew were at the
boilers, there was nearly an explosion. An engineer
averted the accident. Of course, the English would
not have succeeded in opening the Kingston or tearing
off the instructions had it not been for our folly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
It is clear as day that the English should have been
followed about, and not allowed for one moment either
in the engine or boiler compartments. Up to the
present we have not been able to find any contraband.
All the holds where forbidden cargo might lie
are encumbered with a vast quantity of tins of kerosene.
All the tins must be taken out to get below.</p>

<p>9 p.m.&mdash;About noon the <i>Jemchug</i> reported that
she could see a balloon above her. Other ships
also saw it. Those who saw it in the <i>Suvaroff</i> say
it was like a snake in shape.</p>

<p>We are going past Formosa. There is no sight
or sound of the Japanese.</p>

<p><i>May 9th.</i>&mdash;Coaling did not take place. The
weather was rather rough. I slept in the upper
stern cabin.</p>

<p>The <i>Terek</i> has left the fleet, on a cruise to catch
steamers.</p>

<p>The weather is gloomy. It is not so hot. Several
men have already caught colds. Admiral Folkersham's
health is bad. He will probably not reach
Vladivostok alive.</p>

<p>9 p.m.&mdash;<i>North China Sea.</i></p>

<p>We have left the Pacific and entered the North
China Sea. We are going in the direction of
Shanghai, where our transports were sent. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
impossible to let them go alone, now. There are
Japanese ships at Shanghai, watching that our
disarmed ships do not escape.</p>

<p>We passed by Formosa&mdash;passed by part of the
small Japanese islands. Vladivostok is getting
nearer and nearer. We have only to cross the North
China Sea and the straits of Korea to enter the
sea of Japan, on the shores of which is the long-desired
Vladivostok. What are the Japanese
doing? Where are they? No doubt preparing a
hearty welcome for us.</p>

<p>There will probably be frantic torpedo attacks
in the straits of Korea. The moon rises late and
makes the night attacks easier. Will there be a
fleet action? Probably it will be more advantageous
for Japan to give battle on arrival at Vladivostok.
Our fleet has made a great voyage and is bound
to protect the transports. Probably Japanese
mines have been placed at Vladivostok.</p>

<p>In seven days the whole world will be talking
about our fleet. After sunset the crew are ordered
to put on flannel jerseys. It is proposed to-morrow
to carry out the coaling, which did not take place
to-day.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be possible to send letters to one
of the transports going to Shanghai.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>There is apparently an opportunity of sending a
mail, but no one evidently is preparing to take
advantage of it.</p>

<p><i>May 10th.</i>&mdash;<i>North China Sea.</i></p>

<p>The weather is gloomy, but calm, and rather
cold.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Irtish</i> reports that she cannot
go more than eight and a half knots. What can
be done now with that transport? If she goes to
Shanghai, she will have to disarm and be inactive
till the end of the war, as she is under the naval
flag. If she is taken with the fleet, she will be an
extra burden.</p>

<p>I have to send off these pages myself. I can
find no one wishing to send letters home. They
say they will send them from Vladivostok. In the
first place, will they be able to send them from
Vladivostok; and secondly, it is uncertain if they get
there any quicker. There are 1,200 miles, 2,100
versts, left to Vladivostok. Under favourable circumstances
we shall make this passage in six or
seven days.</p>

<h2>NOTE BY MADAME POLITOVSKY</h2>


<p>These were the last pages which were sent from
Shanghai, and received by me (his wife) in the
month of June.</p>

<p>During the battle Engineer E. S. Politovsky
was below, as the battleship <i>Kniaz Suvaroff</i> had had
a hole made in her, and he was probably giving
instructions for its repair. The flag-captain saw
him last in the sick-bay. "How are things going?"
asked Politovsky. "Very badly," answered the
flag-captain. Soon after this some of the staff left
the battleship in the torpedo-boat <i>Biedovy</i>. Those
who were below were not called. There was no
need of them. They saved the "valuable" life
of Admiral Rojdestvensky.</p>
